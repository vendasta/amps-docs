# What are Google Ad Grant Account 

A Google Ad Grant account is a type of advertising account provided by Google to eligible nonprofit 
organizations. Through the Google Ad Grants program, qualifying nonprofits can receive up to 
$10,000 USD per month in free advertising credits to use on Google Ads, Google's online advertising 
platform. These credits can be used to create text ads that appear in Google search results when 
people search for relevant keywords related to the nonprofit's mission or services.

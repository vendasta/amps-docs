# Best Practices for Google Business Profile

When managing a Google Business Profile, if you send an ownership invite, clients may claim they 
haven't received it if you mention it before they check their Gmail. In such cases, sending a 
screenshot showing which account the invite was sent to helps them understand and verify.

Using screenshots like this makes it easier for clients or partners to see exactly what you're referring 
to and reduces confusion.

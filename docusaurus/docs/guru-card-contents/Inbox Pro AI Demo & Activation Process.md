Script & Process

Hello! Thank you for joining me today! I'm excited to get your website set up with InboxPro AI today. 
Before we go ahead and do so, I want to take you through the benefits of this product.

As I'm sure you already know, effective communication and lead management are crucial for building 
strong client relationships in today's market. Small and medium sized businesses (SMBs) rely on quick

responses and real time engagement. However, agencies often face challenges managing multiple 
communication channels, monitoring leads, and responding promptly on your behalf. Capturing and 
tracking leads across platforms can be time intensive and prone to errors.

Sell Them on the AI Tool

Vendasta's Inbox Pro isn't just a communication tool�it's a comprehensive solution that integrates 
seamlessly with AI powered chatbots. This integration allows agencies to engage visitors on their 
clients' websites in real time, capturing leads effortlessly. Leads are automatically synchronized with 
the CRM, eliminating manual data entry and ensuring every interaction is tracked and followed up.

Leads are automatically fed into the CRM, creating contacts without any manual input.

Today, we are going to activate our Inbox Pro AI tool on your account, for FREE, get it onto your 
website, and then train the AI to make it extra intelligent. You'll be able to watch it go from a baseline 
understanding, based on the information it can find on the first page of your website to answering 
much more context questions that may have answers throughout the rest of your website. Lastly, I'll 
walk you through how it connects to our CRM and how you will know what conversations the AI is 
having with your potential customers.

# Duda Website Import Process

  They need to order an Accelerated Templated Website (there's no separate SKU for imports)

* Confirm the following:

* Does the website have custom widgets and what kind (complex vs simple?)

* * If they have any paid subscriptions, they will not transfer, and we need to confirm with the

fulfillment team.

2. We will need their
Duda Transfer Link
 (I would not recommend them giving us that link until we ask 
because it expires in 24 hours)

* Internal magic, republish the site, done.

* Submit a billing concern to refund the setup fee!

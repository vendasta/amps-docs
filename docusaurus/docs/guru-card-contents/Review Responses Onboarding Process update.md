# Review Responses Onboarding Process update

After the Review responses onboarding, we will start adding the required onboarding notes directly in 
the 
separate internal emails anymore.
Account notes. We will not be sending out

Here's the info we'd need to be added in the account notes (
):
please use the same format

Review Response Standard

* Negative approval contact

* Negative review workflow

* Client contact info for negative reviews

* Confirmation of connected platforms (Google/Facebook)

* Credential for 3rd party platforms (if applicable)

* Additional information to consider while drafting review responses

Review Response Plus

* Review requests info

* Is the template approved?

* Reminder frequency

* Reminder contact info

BEST PRACTICE

* Use this same structure for all Reputation accounts moving forward.

* Keep Account Notes up to date as changes come in.

# Zendesk Automation

We have 3 automations set in Zendesk to eliminate follow up responses;

Pending notification 24 hours;

The ticket has been pending for 24 business hours without activity from the partner

/client.

The ticket contains public responses

The ticket does not contain the tag no automatic followup

Pending notification 48 hours

The ticket has been pending for 48 business hours without activity from the partner

/client.

The ticket contains public responses

The ticket does not contain the tag no automatic followup

Open Ticket Following 7 BD

The ticket has been pending for 56 business hours without activity from the partner

/client.

The ticket contains public responses

When a ticket reopens with no partner/client response after 7 business days you are

required to next action; call the partner/client

If you email follow up it will start the above cycle over again   please complete this

cycle twice then consider the project as bounced back.

You will not see the automated response within the ticket, you need to click into Events to see the

system as triggered an automated response.

want the automated response cycle to occur on one of your tickets you 
DO NOT 
will need to use the macro no automatic follow up is required & leave an internal note stating why. 
This will tag your ticket according.

Homefield signature automatically have the no automatic followup tag added.

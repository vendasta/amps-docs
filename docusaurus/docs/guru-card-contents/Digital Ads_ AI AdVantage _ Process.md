Pausing an Ad

When a partner requests to pause a campaign, we need to determine how the period of time the 
campaign should be paused for.

2 possible scenarios:

If the campaign needs to be paused briefly (a few days), we can accommodate this request.

If the campaign needs to be paused a long period of time (over 1 month) or if the pause period

will overlap with their billing date, we recommend the partner should cancel the product to

avoid being billed.

Notes:

* Pausing a campaign in MatchCraft does NOT pause the billing in Partner Center

* Conversely, canceling the product in Partner Center does NOT pause the campaign in MatchCraft

* The marketing coordinator must ensure these 2 tasks align and ensure the appropriation actions

are taken to fulfill the partners request.

Requesting a pause:
Go to the slack channel #dads internal and submit a request to pause the campaign.

Fill in this template:
Pause Request @digital ads specialists and the appropriate Account Manager.
PID:
AGID:
Campaign:
Did they give a reactivation date:
Reason for Pause:

Short Term Pause Request:
We allow campaigns to be paused for a maximum of 2 days. Any requests more than 2 days need to 
be approved by your team lead. Any request more than 30 days is considered long term.

  Confirm how long the campaign needs to be paused for and submit a pause request in #dads 
internal 
  If a specialist is unable to take immediate action to pause the campaign, please tag your team lead 
or manager and request they pause the campaign.

2.Create a task in VTM called "Ad Campaign | Pause".

3  In the notes, let the specialist know the campaign will be paused and is set to resume in 2 business
days and give the exact date. Ex. Saranya TC 3/16/21: pause the campaign for 2 days and resume on 
March 18th.

  Go to MatchCraft and double check the campaign is paused.

5.Email the partner letting them know the campaign has been paused and set the Zendesk ticket 
reminder time for 2 business days

  Once the 2 days has passed, email them to let them know their campaign has been turned back on.

Long Term Pause Request (More than 30 days):

1  Ensure to follow up with the partner to cancel the products on the Partner Center to avoid being
billed.

2  Once the product is cancelled, create the termination task and make sure to update the task note
saying that this is temporary and the partner will reactivate the campaign.

Terminating an Ad

:::tip
Note: Cancellation emails are received when the products are cancelled in partner center, 
deactivation emails are received when the cancelled products hit their next billing date and doesn't 
renew.
:::

Upon receiving a cancellation email from the partner/system:

  Check Partner Center to double check if the products are actually cancelled.

2  Create a task in VTM called "Ad Campaign | Termination" and assign it to the Specialist. In the
notes, let the specialist know that the campaign needs to be terminated.

  Create an Internal Zendesk ticket using macro "Digital Ads   [SMB Name]   Specialist Thread  

" . Set the status to Urgent and assign it to the specialist on the 
[Google/Display/YouTube/Facebook]

campaign as open.

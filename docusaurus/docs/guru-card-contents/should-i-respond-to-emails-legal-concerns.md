# Should I Respond To Emails That has Legal Concerns.

Legal matters can be for multiple different reasons. Whenever we do receive these emails before we
craft a response. Copy and paste the entire email and attachment to the relevant public channels. Tag
the fulfillment team lead, managers and comms manager.

Once they have eyes on this ask if this is something that we are legally responsible for and what the
next steps?

If the email is from the client loop the Partner in on a separate email thread. With the response you
receive from the team. CC Account Manager.

Ask the Partner how they would prefer communications be handled on this.

Proceed with next next as according to the Partner Response.

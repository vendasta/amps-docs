## Tier 0 Social Edits

Why do we need a Tier 0?

• The purpose of Tier 0s is to have CE tackle fast and easy changes on their own to avoid

the 2_day turnaround from the social team and gives our customers a better experience.

What types of things are considered Tier 0?

• These are things that can be done in about 5 minutes and saves the back_and_forth

email communication with us, like:

• Responding to questions where the answer can be found on the product page or in Guru

• Text changes where the updated wording is provided

• Image changes where the image is provided

• Requests to delete a post, especially if the post is scheduled within the next 2 days

For any questions, please tag in the Social Team and they will be able to help you. Do not tag
Ashley as she is leaving the company.

## Communications Core Services Onboard Check List

1. Onboard call will be pre_booked by the admin team.

2. Prep for the Call

    a. Social Posting _ Check social networks are connected in Social Marketing. If they are not, make note and discuss how or walk the Partner/SMB through the process in the call.

    b. Review Responses _ Check if review sites have been connected in Reputation Management. Review the order form and see what sites they want us to respond to reviews on and make note if we have credentials for any sites apart from Facebook or Google Business Profile (these can be connected in Reputation Management).

    c. Review Requests _ Create the Review Request template in Customer Voice. Use a

HQ banner orientation image (if they do not provide one, you can often pull

something from their website or other social accounts).

**See Guru card on creating Review Request Template.

    i. Send a test Review request to the contacts for the project from Customer
Voice.

    ii. Send a screen shot of the template to the Partner/SMB for approval

    d. Local Listing Management _ Please, review the Tasks in VTM prior to onboarding.

We will need to know the status of the GBP Claim, and be able to assist with the

Apple Maps Claim.

    i. GBP _ Check claim & verification task notes to determine what methods are

available to try on the call. The listing team may have already initiated

verification if the only option was postcard or we have requested access to

an existing listing. You can
review this doc
 for more info

    ii. Apple Maps Claim _ You can
review this doc
 for more info

    iii. Retroactive Review Responses _ (if applicable) If not done already, attempt

to check that there are indeed reviews on the business's GBP that are within

the last 3 months before proceeding. If none, skip this step.

3. Onboard Call

    a. Make sure you add marketingservices@yourdigitalagents.com to the call ahead
of time to ensure Notetaker/Wingman shows up to record the call.

    b. Follow the following steps for each product line.

4. Complete Social Questionnaire _ there are two options to complete this.

5. Fill out this OR Social Discovery Questionnaire _ OR fill out the Social Questionnaire on VTM (See below for how to find this.)

**NOTE _ For accounts with Facebook Post Boosting we need to have Meta Business Manager access to the Facebook page for us to boost the posts.**

    ii. Review Responses

    a. Who do we send negative reviews and our suggested response to for approval? Does the Partner/SMB want to approve responses to negative reviews before we post them or not? Confirm their choice.

    b. Options: No approval needed | 24 Hour Approval Window (contact who will be approving is needed) | Contact information at the business (email or phone) to direct negative reviewers to.

    i. Confirm negative review workflow

    ii. Confirm contact for approval

    iii. Review Requests

1. Create Review Template and get it approved on call when possible.

2. How frequently do they want a reminder to send over a customer list for review requests?

    a. How frequently? (Monthly / Bi_Monthly / Quarterly)

    b. Who should we send reminders to?

3. Who should we send the Review Request customer list reminders to?

    iv. Local Listing Management

1. GBP Claim

    a. &lt; If phone call verification&gt; Does your business phone number

have an automated answer machine? If so, can you disable it

briefly for the next 10 minutes or less? Google will be sending a

code to your business phone number. Are you ready for me to

push that code through now?

&lt;If they can't disable answer machine and this was the only option

&gt; We will have to reach out to Google to request another

verification method, we will let you know what they are able to

offer as an alternative option. They might ask us for business

documentation, so if you would be able to send us an image or

scan of a utility bill or official document that shows your business

name and address on it then that will help speed up the process.

    b. &lt; If email verification&gt; Google has given us the option to send a

code to the business email so I will send that through now. It may

take a minute or two, but please let me know if you see that come

in. You might have to check spam or junk folders if you do not see

it after a couple of minutes.

    c. &lt;If SMS verification&gt; It looks like we have the option to push

through an SMS code for verification. Is the business number

connected to a cell phone that can receive texts? &lt;If yes, proceed,

if no, choose alternative method&gt;

    d. &lt;If postcard verification has been initiated&gt; It looks like Google

has only given us the option to send a physical postcard to the

business address. Our team has already sent the postcard on

(check task note for date), and it should arrive within 5 to 30

business days. Please let us know when that is received at the

business and email us with the code at (comms contact email

here).

    e. &lt;If video verification is only option&gt; INPUT STEPS TO HELP SMB

COMPLETE VIDEO VERICATION HERE _ It looks like the Google

verification was successful! Our team will be going in and

ensuring that any of the information that was provided to us

beforehand including logo, cover image, additional images,

products, and services are updated on the listing! You should

already have an ownership invite that was sent to your email

(given on order form) so please check for that if you haven't

already.

    f. &lt;IF LISTING IS IMMEDIATELY SUSPENDED&gt; It looks like Google has suspended the listing. Sometimes they do this when manual

checks are required. Not to worry, our team will be working with

Google support directly to get the listing reinstated. We will

update you when we know more. Google will likely ask us for

business documentation, so if you would be able to send us an

image or scan of a utility bill or official document that shows your

business name and address on it then that will help speed up the

process.

2. Apple Maps Claim

    a. &lt;IF THE BUSINESS IS A SERVICE AREA BUSINESS AND CANNOT

HAVE ITS ADDRESS SHOWN, SKIP THIS SECTION!&gt;

Next we will be working to claim and verify the Apple Maps listing

for your business. In order to start the claiming process we will

need to sign in using an Apple ID. Do you happen to have an

existing Apple ID for yourself or the business that you are

comfortable sharing the credentials for and would prefer I use? If

not I can create one for the business now and share the

credentials with you after the call.

    b. &lt;If given existing Apple ID, proceed to Claim & Verify steps, if

creating new ID proceed to Create SMB Apple ID steps&gt;

    i. Jump to Create SMB Apple ID

    ii. Jump to Apple Claim & Verification

3. Retroactive Review Responses

    a. &lt;If not done already, attempt to check that there are indeed

reviews on the business's GBP that are within the last 3 months

before proceeding. If none, skip this step.&gt;

As part of this service, we will also go through and respond on

your behalf to reviews that were left within the last three months

on Google. Our team will automatically post responses to reviews

that are positive, which we count as reviews that are 4 stars or

higher.

For negative reviews, which are reviews that are 3 stars or lower, I

wanted to verify that the information we have is correct as far as

how you'd like us to deal with these reviews if we find any within

the last three months.

First I want to confirm the approval process we will be using. Is

(insert order form answer here) still the process you would like to

follow?

    b. &lt;If they are unsure&gt; Our suggestion is to follow the 24 hour

approval process, which means we will send you our suggested

response to approve or give edits by email, but if you don't take

action on that email within 24 hours we will go ahead and post

the response.

I wanted to confirm the negative review contact which is needed

because we will be encouraging the reviewer to take the

conversation offline and contact the business directly. &lt;Confirm

negative review contact given on order form&gt;

4. Send Post Onboard email to the Partner/SMB in Zendesk

Delete all other services EXCEPT the ones ordered.

## Listings Flow Chart

Purpose:
This flow chart linked below outlines the step_by_step process for claiming Google listings
using an "If This, Then That" format. It is designed to help the Client Engagement team better
understand the processes involved on both the Fulfillment and Client Engagement sides. By
highlighting key decision points and potential nuances, this guide provides insight into what
Client Engagement can expect when working with Google listings and what specific
information they may need to gather in advance.

Objective:
The goal is to streamline communication between Listings and Client Engagement teams by
providing a clear visual of each step, reducing unnecessary back_and_forth, and enabling more
efficient responses to clients. This will lead to faster resolutions and improved customer
satisfaction.

How it Works:

• Step_by_Step Guide: The flow chart breaks down each action required to claim a Google

listing, with corresponding "If this, then that" logic to illustrate potential outcomes.

• Clarifying Expectations: By understanding the different scenarios and information

required at each stage, Client Engagement will be better prepared to manage client

expectations and gather necessary details upfront.

• Reducing Communication Gaps: This visual tool minimizes misunderstandings between

teams, enhancing overall efficiency in resolving client inquiries related to Google listing

claims.

This Guru Card empowers Client Engagement to proactively address client needs and quickly
resolve any issues, that are in their control, related to Google listing claims.

Documents required to reach out to Google support to request live verification

Listings

for listing

Documents required to reach out to Google
support to request live verification for listing

• Picture of the outside of your business, which shows clear signage ( MANDATORY)

• Picture of the outside of your business which shows address markers (e.g street name,

number) or landmarks (e.g adjacent stores) ( MANDATORY)

• Business license and utility bills

## Google Listing is stuck in the verification stage

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/05.png)

When the status on a listing exceeds more than 5 days in this stage this is a glitch with Google
and we can only sort it out by reaching out to Google support.

They will need the following to reach out to Google:

• a business license, business permanent signage image, and a utility bill

## Primary ownership on Google listing

Once we have given the ownership of the listing, we need to wait one week to make that email
address the primary owner of the listing. To know more about how to give ownership of the
listing to an email address, please look at this
.
Guru card by Kendall

We follow the same process as stated in the above Guru card but this time we select "Primary
owner" from the option.

Step 1: Once you are on the Google listing, select the three dots on top right.

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/06.png)

Step 2: As shown in the picture, click on "Business Profile Settings"

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/07.png)

Step 3: In this case, this email address is already the owner of the page. They were added over
one week ago, hence we will be able to make this email a primary owner of this listing. As
shown in the screenshot, click on the arrow on the right (as marked)

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/08.png)

Step 4: It will take you to this page. Now, click on the pencil icon to edit.

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/09.png)

Step 5: Now, you will see the "Primary owner" option. You can select that option and save the
changes.

Video Verification _ How to Verify a Google
Business Profile With a Business Video

Attachment to send directly to business owners completing verification __&gt;
Google Video
Verification Instructions.docx

Business videos give clients the opportunity to show required assets to Google in a continuous
recording. This process is entirely up to the client, as they need to be at the business address
(whether an office building, worksite, or home) to complete the video recording. Business
verification options do not expire and can be completed whenever is convenient for the client.

Before beginning, ensure that the user who is completing the verification is an owner on the
Google Business Profile and can access the listing on the device they will be using to complete
the video verification.

In order to verify their listing, the client will need access to the following:

1. Google Business Profile listing that requires verification via business video

2. A cell phone or tablet on which to record the video

3. A stable internet connection

Here are the steps the client can follow to verify their listing via business video:

Service Area Business_Specific Information

Please note that the items captured in your footage may change depending on your
business's classification as a public_facing storefront OR service area business. A service area

is any business that makes
 with a consumer in public or at the
business
physical contact
consumer's residence. This would usually include businesses like plumbers, contractors,
technicians, etc. If your customers are able to travel to your office then your business is not a
service area business and rather a physical location.

The three elements that must be captured for your service area business video verification as
seen below are:

1. Location of your business office

    a. Include street signs, nearby businesses if applicable, and the surrounding area.

The service area you chose for your business should match the location of your

office location, including home offices.

2. Physical examples of your business name present at your office that matches the

name of the Google Business Profile

    a. Business cards, branded vehicles, business tools, and equipment used to

complete the service you offer.

3. Proof of your authorization to verify the business

    a. This includes showing in the video the ability to unlock the company vehicle,

logging in to online tools or software used in your operations without showing

passwords or sensistive information, as well as proving that you are able to

unlock and enter the residence for the address that's been chosen for the

Google Business Profile.
 Even though you are proving to Google the

legitimacy of the address, it will not be shown to customers live on Google if set

up as a service area listing.

Live Video Verification

Video Verification _ How to Verify a Google Business Profile With a Business

Listings

Video

• This option is made available by Google support when we have utilized all other

methods (phone call, email, business video) and still haven't got verified.

• It requires a ticket submission by our Listings specialist with documentation like picture

of business signage from outside and utility bills matching their name and address.

• Once it is visible, inform the partner/client and inform them to complete it at the earliest

since it can go away in 3_4 days.

• Process:

• The user will jump on a video call with one of the Google representatives and they

will ask for necessary proofs.

• The user should confirm at the end if the rep is satisfied with all they have seen and

that their profile will be verified.

• The profile gets verified!

• Important Point: For profiles of Doctors' working for a hospital or organization, Google

has certain mandates.

• They need to show a POS machine to receive payments (credit/debit).

• The profile nomenclature should follow this format: Dr [First Name] [Last Name],

[Degree] E.g., Dr Jane Doe, DO

• They might ask the person to access their appointment booking system or any other

platform they use so they need to have required authorization to complete this step.

## Verifying Google Listing through Video Call

If we are unable to verify Google listing through other means, we can request another option and Google may suggest a video verification call.

What we will need from the client in order to complete this request is some pictures:

1. The business store front as seen from the street and/or in front of your shop. (Required) Signage that shows the name of the business and its entrance. (Required) The inside of the business. (Optional) Link that shows Google Street View imagery of the street and/or neighborhood in which your business is located. (Optional) Name and website URL of the venue in which your business resides, like a shopping mall. (Optional)

Once Google offers to do a video call verification with the client we will email the client asking
for a date and time for each property during the time frame that Google support suggested to
do the video verification call.

We do not join the verification video call as it must be completed with someone who is
physically on_site at the property during open hours. The client must join the call
approximately 5 minutes before it begins as in the past, if Google joins the call and there is no
one waiting at the moment it begins, they leave.

On the call, usually Google support just asks for a tour of the premises and to see the main
office where clients can go. This call usually lasts a maximum of 20 minutes. Once the call is
complete, Google will look into verifying the business location.

The property also must log in to the provided Gmail account and complete the call and cannot
join the call using their own personal or work Gmail accounts.

## Listings FAQ | How long does a Bing request take?

Bing takes
 for any edits or updates to be published, However sometimes the
 7 business days
changes don't go through so after 7 business days, the listings team will contact Bing Support.

## Local Listings Management | Apple Maps Claim Process

Local Listings Management | Apple Maps Claim
Process

This Guru Card will walk you through how to complete the Apple Maps listing claim (included
in the Local Listings Management product.)

NOTE: Apple does not allow claiming service area businesses. Do NOT proceed with this
process if it's a service area business.

Items Needed from Client:

• Login credentials for the Apple ID they would like to tie to the business listing.

• If they do not want to share this with us, we can create a new one for the business.

If Creating a New Apple ID:

If SMB does not want to use an existing Apple ID for the Apple Maps claim, then a new Apple
ID will have to be created. Ideally, the business's email and a phone number readily available
to the main contact at the business will be used to create the Apple ID.

1. Go to
 and click "Sign in" at the top right.
https://businessconnect.apple.com/

2. Click on "Don't have an Apple ID?
."
Create yours now

3. Fill out the information using the SMB's contacts info. It is best to use the business

email and phone number readily available to the main contact

After this, the listing may go into PROCESSING or Apple may reject the verification.

• If the Apple listing isn't verified or is stuck in processing, we will check on it during their

monthly NAP check to see where we're at and will continue checking on the listing

monthly in accordance with the monthly checks.

• The client is free to check on the listing themselves as often as they'd like, and if they

see something change or if they'd like support they can reach out to Comms

How Do We Do Phone/Text Verification for GMB
Listings With Automated Answering Machines?

When Google requests Phone call/text verification for a GMB listing, but the number
associated with the listing is an automated phone answering machine, there are a few options
in order to proceed:

• Turn off the automated answering machine while we push through the verification call.

• This is the best course of action, so if possible, try this.

• Change the phone number on the listing to a non_automated number.

• Note that in order to change the number back to the automated answering
machine number, you will need to reverify the listing.

• Have the listing team reach out to Google in order to get a new verification method.

## Why we do not use AI detection tools for our Blogs Services

Why we do not use AI detection tools for our
Blogs Services

Dear [Partner Name],

AI has truly transformed the way content is being created, and we're staying at the forefront
of this trend. While we do use AI as part of our process, we also guarantee that all of our
content is always reviewed and refined for humans by humans to ensure the quality and
authenticity of the work we're delivering.

The following is some information regarding our blog writing process specifically concerning
the use of AI checkers for blogs.

In the past, we have used AI checkers and it is worth noting that even when the blogs were
100% written by humans, they would still be flagged by AI checkers. After thorough
evaluation, we have determined that this approach is not meeting our expectations for several
reasons:

1. Inconsistency in Results: AI checkers often produce inconsistent evaluations of

content quality. This inconsistency can lead to unnecessary revisions and delays,

impacting our ability to deliver your content promptly.

2. Inaccurate Assessments: AI checkers sometimes misjudge the quality of content.

They may flag well_written, high_quality content as problematic while failing to

identify actual issues. This can result in unnecessary edits that do not improve the

content and might even detract from its overall quality.

3.  Google's Algorithm Prioritizes Quality: Google's latest updates emphasize the

importance of high_quality, relevant content rather than the method of creation.

While AI_generated content is not penalized per se, low_quality content is. Our focus

is on ensuring that every piece we deliver meets the highest standards of quality and

relevance, aligning with your brand's objectives and audience expectations.

Given these considerations, we have decided to discontinue the use of AI checkers, including
tools like ZeroGPT, in our content review process. Instead, we dedicate our efforts to rigorous,
human_led review processes that prioritize quality and relevance.

For further insights into the reliability of AI detection tools, you can refer to this article:
What

.
Do We Know About the Reliability of AI Detection Tools?

We remain committed to delivering exceptional content that resonates with your target
audience and supports the brands' goals.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

## CMIT Blog Approval and Upload Process

Please note: The CMIT partnership is not white_labeled, all parties know about Vendasta and
our role in the partnership.

We don't host the CMIT franchisee microsites, however we have reached an agreement with
CMIT home office on a workflow for getting the blogs uploaded to the microsites utilizing
Alpha SEO's access.

1. When the blog is ready to send, email it to the client as normal using the email

"cmit@yourdigitalagents.com".

2. The edit process is the standard process for our content team (edit up to 30%, 2

business day turnaround)

3. Follow up after 3 days if you haven't received edits after the first email. After 3 more

days, consider the blog approved.

4. Following approval (or 3 days after the 2nd follow_up), close the client ticket, and start

a new ticket using the "CMIT Blog Upload" Macro. Attach the blog and photos, and

send them to Alpha SEO Support (cc: Lauren Dressler) using cmit@yourdigitalagents.

com.

    a. Be sure to add the "no_survey" and "no_send_solved_notifier" tags to the Alpha

SEO ticket.

5. When Alpha SEO Support confirms that the blog is up, you can close the ticket.

## MS _ Blog Edits/Rewrite Process

After receiving an edit to a blog that we wrote, please follow these steps to ensure the edit is
conveyed to the writers!

For each blog, SMBs get 1 rounds of edits! Edits have to be submitted by the SMBs within 5_7
business days since receipt of the blog.

Head over to VTM and search for the correct Blog Project. (eg, October Blog #3 _ you will find
this in completed tasks)

1. Create a task within the project and use this file for the correct task name assigned to

"Writer" with the due date as indicated on the spreadsheet. (Be sure to include

relevant notes. Name/date/ Zendesk ticket # / what the edit is).

2. Please tag @ ContentLeaders and Harini in project comments. The content team will

rename the task if there are extensive edits and calls for a rewrite. ( Rewrite Blog)

3. In your Zendesk ticket, link this task to your internal notes so there is proof of

submission for the team member covering for you.

4. Once the writers have completed the edits, the writer will create and assign the "Send

Blog" to the CE person responsible for the project. Go to the main Zendesk ticket and

inform your client/partner.

After receiving a suspected rewrite (only 1 rewrite permitted per blog), we need to tag the
@contentleaders in project comments and ask for approval.

Once approved, the content leaders will create the "Blog Rewrite" task in the same file as
above and assign it to the team member responsible for rewriting the blog.

## Blog Posts

## FAQs for Review Responses & Requests

1) Do I need to cancel Reputation Management Trial immediately when Review Responses
order is place?
A. No. Reputation Management just needs to be active to complete this order. Our team will
notify the partner before trial ends and they can upgrade to Reputation Management Express
/Pro later.

2) If my client switches from customer voice pro to express, will they lose all of the clients they
currently have listed in their account.
A. No. However, with downgrade to Customer Voice Express they will lose features like bulk
review requests, automated_follow_up email, SMS add_ons, and mobile kiosk.

3) Why do I need to purchase Reputation Management Pro and not Reputation Management
Express?
A. Reputation Management Express is sufficient for Google/Facebook reviews, but for
additional platforms like Yelp, Pro is required.

their reviews on the correct listing?
A. No. However, it is advisable to have the duplicate listing closed by contacting the platform
(Google, Yelp, etc.)

5) Do you respond to all negative reviews or only negative reviews with comments?
A. We respond to all negative reviews with or without comments.

6) My client has possible fake reviews, can you remove them?
A. We can report these reviews to the platform (Google/Facebook/Yelp) and if they violate their
policy they can delete them. However, we cannot guarantee their removal.

7) I want review requests sent out frequently, can you do it weekly?
A. Yes, we can customize as per business requirements. (Our usual option is monthly/bi_
monthly/quarterly)

8) Can you edit the bottom part of review request template?
A. No.

reviews. Also, we just use email address to send review requests and the SMB can choose not
to send the first and last names inform.

## Social Team _ How to Fulfill Social Page Build for Instagram

Social Team _ How to Fulfill Social Page Build for
Instagram

When an SMB orders Social Page Build for Instagram, the Client Engagement team will be
working with the SMB by calling them to create the page for them. This will include the
following:

• Creating the account

• Adding a profile picture

• Editing and updating the business information such as their website, bio, and phone

number

• Conversion of the account to a business account

• Connect the Instagram account to the corresponding Facebook Business page (if

applicable)

• Walkthrough on how to manage the Instagram account going forward_ we'll share some

insights on how to best drive traffic, share interesting content, and more!

• Post 5 images _ with filters, hashtags, and descriptions, within the first two weeks of the

account being created.

The Social Team comes in for the final step in the process! We will be creating five posts for the
SMB to get their activity on their new page started. Use the following steps to complete this
process:

1. When the Client Engagement team has tagged us in the VTM task and sent us an

email at
, we will review the notes to determine
wordnerdz@yourdigitalagents.com

what the business needs for their posts. Some content may be provided which we will

follow. If no content is provided, please refer to this
 for the templates
document

created for this product.

2. Confirm that you have all the necessary information to create the posts. You will need

to know:

    a. The Instagram handle

    b. The business name

    c. The business website

    d. Any other info they require

3. If we will be posting on the business's behalf, make sure we know if they have Social

Marketing activated, and if not, make sure we have access to their login credentials. If

this is not included in the email, refer to the VTM Account Notes. If they are not there,

please ask the Marketing Coordinator for this. If the business has requested post

approval, the Marketing Coordinator will indicate this in their email.

4. Unless they specify otherwise, we will create three business posts and two engaging

posts for the business. The posts can be created in this
. Please create a
document

new tab titled with the name of the business. If you are using the templates, copy and

paste them and fill in the necessary information. If you are writing based on the

content the business provided, create them as required.

5. If the business requires approval, put the captions and images into
 and
this template

then click File&gt;Download&gt;PDF Document (.pdf) and send the PDF to the Marketing

Coordinator. Also, follow this process if the business is posting itself.

    a. If we are posting for them, once approval is granted, follow the steps below.

6. If no approval is required and/or the business has asked us to post for them, follow

these steps:

    a. If Social Marketing is activated: schedule the posts throughout the following two

weeks.

    b. If Social Marketing is not activated, log into their Instagram account and post the

first post. Set yourself reminders for the remaining four posts throughout the

following two weeks.

7. Once the posts are scheduled
 you have set up your posting reminders, reply to the
or

email thread letting the Marketing Coordinator know when the posts will be expected

to go out.

8. Finally, when the last of the five posts has been posted, email the Marketing

Coordinator to let them the service is complete!

## Can videos be linked to Instagram's clickable bio posts?

Can videos be linked to Instagram's clickable bio
posts?

Currently, only images and GIF support clickable.bio

## Can we/my client/my account have a dedicated social writer?

Can we/my client/my account have a dedicated
social writer?

Probably not, as it's not the most efficient way for the Social Team to effectively write posts in
a timely fashion on a monthly basis.

It's best to reach out to one of the leaders of the Social Team to inquire about this, before
providing any responses to the partner/SMB.

    c. ONBOARDING SCRIPT TALK TRACK

The content and strategy session consists of a monthly meeting with a marketing strategist to
discuss content ideas, social media strategy, and review posts performance for content
previously published by our team.

If you cannot find a time to complete this call, we can send a monthly analysis and our
recommendations in an email.

What will be covered in the monthly session:

• Review content and performance of your previous posts

• Content ideas to appeal to your target audience

• Suggested strategies to drive more engagement

• Refining post styles (casual vs formal, promotional vs educational)

• Post boosting strategy

• And more

If you have content suggestions or specific photos, please send them to our Marketing
Strategists by the 10th of the month. The posts will then be prepared by our team, and sent
out for approval 5 business days before the first post is scheduled to publish. If no response is
received within 5 business days, the posts will be published as_is.

CONTENT & STRATEGY FAQ / BEST PRACTICE

• Have the account pulled up before the call and REVIEW the content before every call.

• Only 1% of the reach will result in engagement

• ie: For every 100 people who see the post, approx 1 person will interact (Like,
Share, Comment) with the post.

• Best Practice: Post everything about your business to the Business page and share to
your personal page. Never post directly about the business on the personal page,
instead post to the business account and share it to your personal page!

• Best Practice: Get your family & friends to follow your pages!!! Get them to like, share
and comment. Sometimes you need to start the conversation!

• Personal posts tend to have a high engagement. It adds the human element to the
business.

• Get to know the face behind the business

• Employee spotlights

• Submit images!! Posts with individual, unique images perform better than posts with
stock images.

• Make note of upcoming events, holidays, seasons, sales etc

• Black Friday

• Christmas

• holiday marketing campaigns

• Note country of operation (ie Canadian Thanksgiving _ October vs American
Thanksgiving _ November)

• Back to school

• Take a look at the primary platform, which one are we writing for? Which platform is
performing the best. Suggest changing to a better performing platform if the reach and
engagement is much higher on a secondary platform (for Extended Reach)

• Facebook _ Community Based. It is based around building community and tends
to be informative, conversational, a good place to share articles/blogs etc

• Google Business Profile _ Call to Action Based. Call Now, Visit Us, Shop Now. Posts
are only highlighted for 7 days.

• Instagram _ Great place to showcase new products. Instagram mostly focuses on
engagement. #ThisorThat posts perform well here, holiday wishes, things of that
nature. For Instagram, comments and likes are the biggest focus here.

• LinkedIn_ More professional than the other platforms. Mostly Business and
Industry related posts. Talk about how established the business is (How many
years of service, client/customer reviews)

• Twitter_ Community Engagement based, very similar to Facebook. Share articles
and call to actions.

• Pinterest_ Good for sharing more fun or cutesy content with the audience. Not as
much of a space to promote the business itself (however, it can be done). It is
more about industry articles _think blogs_ and showing off fun project ideas that
relate to the business.

## Social Onboarding & Communications Workflow

Social Post 1x Week

1. Complete admin work and continue the next steps:

regarding outstanding assets or red flags that arose from the order form. Please

action these items ahead of the call if possible.

3. Send FB Business Manager Access _ Log into Digital Marketing Services Facebook

Manager and send a FB Business Manager Admin access request to the SMB FB page.

the Social Networks we are fulfilling services on (Facebook, Google Business Profile,

LinkedIn, Twitter, and/or Instagram).

8. Follow Up _ Follow up with the Partner / SMB every 2 days to obtain remaining assets

and information needed after the onboard call until we have received everything. If

you do not hear back from the client after 4 attempts to follow up, follow the No

Response Bounce Back Process (see below).

    a. A Follow up project needs to be created through the VMKS Vendor Center Orders

Table if there are remaining onboarding tasks needing to be completed. This is

done so that it does not affect the fulfillment's days to deliver metric. Add all

remaining onboard tasks to this project. It needs to be done through the Vendor

Center so that it shows up in both VMKS and the Partner PID.

9. After the initial social calendar is written by the social team, the Social Team will send

an automated email with the first month's social calendar to the account users. After

the calendar is sent, the SMB or Partner has 5 business days to submit edits to the

posts. If the edits are simple, complete them and notify the client they are completed

and updated. If they are extensive or require post replacements, reach out to the

Social Team to complete.

tasks. Send the Transition to Support email off to the Partner/SMB.

## How_To: Delete Instagram Posts using Meta

Deleting posts through Social Marketing is only applicable to certain platforms that allow for
third_party services. Instagram isn't one of these current platforms which can cause issues
when deleting something on Facebook that extends to Instagram. You now can delete
through Meta Business Suite!

Once you have access to the Facebook book page through our Business Manager, or their
direct credentials to login to their page and once Instagram is synced as a business page with
their Facebook it becomes possible.

Step 1: You will sign in directly or view page from Business Manager.

Step 2: Find
 and continue to their Meta Dashboard &gt; click

Meta Business Suite
Posts & Stories
on the left_hand side. This will showcase all the photos, reels, and videos shared in
chronological order.

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/71.png)

Step 3: Filter or scroll until you see the date and post you want to delete, and ensure it is on
the Instagram platform (it shows Facebook posts and Instagram posts separately via icon to
show you which platform it was posted to)

Step 4: Click the 3 horizontal dots beside
&gt; a drop down will appear with
boost post
delete post
as an option, this will delete it.

Side Note: You can click on the entire row of the post to find out more information related to
its performance individually, and the 3 horizontal dots to delete the post will showcase on this
portion of the screen as well. Example of this above.

## Social Marketing | Expired LinkedIn Connection Process

Social Marketing | Expired LinkedIn Connection
Process

Since LinkedIn requires users to reconnect their account in Social Marketing Pro every few
weeks, the social team will often reach out on VTM by tagging the respective Comms person
assigned to the account to reach out to the client or partner in order to get them to reconnect
the account.

1. Once the Social Team tags you, please respond to let the team know you will reach

out regarding the expired connection.

2. Navigate to VTM and open the account notes for that account. If we have the

LinkedIn login credentials in there, we can renew the connection ourselves. If not,

please proceed with the next steps to reach out to the SMB to renew the connection.

3. Create a new Zendesk ticket. Set the requester/CC's based on the contact info for

Social Posts from the VTM account notes.

    a. Subject:
_ LinkedIn Expired |
[SMB]
 [AGID]

    b. Body:

Hi
,
[name]

I hope this email finds you well! I'm just reaching out because [name of the

's LinkedIn connection for
 has expired on
personal linked in account]
 [business]

our Social Marketing platform.

If you can get this reconnected in our platform at your earliest convenience, we

can ensure that the social posts continue to get posted to the
 page.
[business]

Please let me know once this is reconnected so I can update the Social Team.

Alternatively, I can reconnect this on your behalf if you would like to share the

login credentials for the LinkedIn page. If you have any questions, please let me

know, and I'll be happy to help!

4. Set the above ticket to Pending with a due date of 2 business days to follow_up.

5. Update the VTM respectively under project comments that you have reached out to

them and link the VTM under Internal notes on Zendesk.

6. Once it has been reconnected, notify the Social team on VTM via project comments.

You may then solve both tickets.

## Social Page Build _ Instagram Process

The Social Page Build process includes posting 5 times on the new Instagram account that we
build.

Our Comms team is responsible for collecting the necessary information from our Partner
/Client and providing it to our Social team. You can view the Social Page Build script
 and
here,
remind yourself of the questions you must ask while onboarding for Instagram.

POST ONBOARD PROCESS:

• Once the onboard is completed, you must update the "Fulfill Social Posts for Instagram"

task in VTM

• Please, include all of the information provided by the Client & Partner into this task.

This includes topics, preferences, photos, photo preference, hashtags, copy, ideas,

suggestions, Instagram login credentials, etc. Anything that our team needs to know

about must be included in this task.

• If the client does not have content they want us to use, the Social Team will have

templates they can work from.

• Please ask the SMB if they would like to receive the posts for approval before they

are posted.

• Please also confirm with them if they will handle the posting themselves or if they

would like the team to handle that for them.

• Please @ / tag the Social Team within the task. This will notify them by email that their

attention is required

• Please create a new ticket in Zendesk, and provide all information, including the items

listed above, AGID, PID, VTM Link and Instagram credentials, in your email to the Social

Team. Please, follow up after 2_business days if you have not received a response.

• Social Team will take this task once the email has been received and craft five posts.

Their process can be found
here
. If approval is necessary and/or if the SMB wants to

post themselves, the Social Team will send them in a PDF back to the COMMs Team. If

the SMB does not require approval and wants us to post for them, Social Team will reply

to the email once the posts are created with the posting schedule for dates and times

when the posts will go out so you can pass that along to the SMB. If the SMB does not

have Social Marketing activated, they will be posted natively following this schedule.

• Hold on to the ticket with your Partner/Client until you can confirm the posts have been

created and scheduled to be posted by our Social Team. It is important to clearly

communicate this to the Partner/Client so they can be aware of the timeline for

fulfillment of this service. There is no approval process included with these posts. If your

partner requests this, please communicate that with the Social team so the posts can be

sent for approval prior to posting.

• Once all posts have gone live, you must communicate to the Partner/Client that the

service has been fulfilled and that their ticket will be solved.

Please, let a leader know if you have any questions. Thank you!

## New Social Questionnaire

https://socialcontentquestionnaire.yourdigitalagents.com/

Update: We have created a social questionnaire form that will be provided in the confirmation
email. We have updated the order confirmation macros for all service levels to include this link
for SOCIAL order confirmations ONLY.

The social questionnaire will be sent to clients PRIOR to their onboarding call to allow the
client more time to gather information about their business.

Once the form is submitted it will be sent to
da_incoming@vendasta.com
The subject line will be as follows: \{Social Posting Creation & Content Form\} New Service
Request for [SMB Name\}

**(see screenshots at the end of this card)
From: socialposting@yourdigitalagents.com
Ex: \{Social Posting Creation & Content Form\} New Service Request for Alliance Gold & Silver
Exchange

Prior to triaging the ticket, we require the team to download the PDF version of the
questionnaire & upload it to the onboarding task in VMKS under "files".

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/82.png)

The admin team will be required to triage the questionnaire to the correct team _ VIP, All_Star
& Classic/Basic.

**if you are wanting to check for submitted Questionnaires, there is a quick and easy way to
find them in Zendesk:

1. In your Zendesk search bar, enter
 and run the
socialposting@yourdigitalagents.com
search

2. Select "Users" from the filter options

## Social Process Expectations for New Partners/Clients

Social Process Expectations for New Partners
/Clients

I just want to provide you with some clarification on the social posts process and how the
team operates:

The team works a month in advance so if you have any specific requests or content you would
like incorporated into a calendar it must be in by the 10th of the prior month. So for example,
anything for December's calendar must be in by November 10th, anything for January must be
in by December 10th and anything for February must be in by January 10th, and so on so
forth.

If you do not have any specific ideas our team does a great job of coming up with relevant
industry content and has documented significant and specific information for each business,
they'd be more than happy to create the posts with that information alone.

The calendar is then provided no later than the 25th of the month so the calendars for
December will be sent out by the end of this week. Once you or the client receives the
calendar, any feedback or revisions you may have can be provided within 5 business days. (we
are lenient on this but want to encourage 5 business days)

Please let me know if you have any questions or if I can clarify anything else.

## How to Schedule Social Calendars in Social Marketing

How to Schedule Social Calendars in Social
Marketing

Please review the "Other Important Notes" section at the end of this card before you get
started in case they apply to the calendar you are scheduling.

Step 1: Locate the business in the WordNerdz Lifeline and make sure the calendar is ready for
scheduling. The status will say Ready to Schedule. Change the status to In Progress
(Scheduling).

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/88.png)

Step 2: Open the corresponding drafting doc from the top of the WordNerdz Lifeline to find
the drafted posts. If the PID is LEE or PRBS, they have their own separate docs (LEE in LEE,
PRBS in PRBS LL). Otherwise, if the PID starts with 0_H, it will be in the 0_H doc and if it starts
with I_Z, it will be in the I_Z doc. The calendar posts should still be coloured as indicated in the

image below.

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/89.png)

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/90.png)

Step 3: Open their Task Manager link and make sure a project is ready to go. If not, you can
create a new recurring project for the business. We use recurring projects so that it will be
recreated every month that we provide the service. To do this, click the Add button in the top
right corner and select Project.

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/91.png)

The screen below will pop up. At the top, there is a field titled Import template. Search for the
project indicated below and select it. It will auto_fill the fields for you.

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/92.png)

The only change you need to make is at the very bottom of this page. The tasks that are
included will be listed. Delete the duplicate tasks that show up at the bottom of the list. These
will be the extra Schedule Social Posts task and the extra Client Review task. Make sure you
delete the ones with the icon of the eye being crossed out. We want to use the ones with the
clear eye icon as this makes them visible to the client and partner in Business App!

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/93.png)

The project should look something like below. Please note, projects will vary slightly if a
calendar is Manual Approval or Non_Approval as seen below.

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/94.png)

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/95.png)

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/96.png)

Step 4: Change the title of the project by replacing the word "Month" with the current month
(e.g.: May).

Step 5: If the Calendar Drafted task or the QA Completed task have not been marked
Completed, reach out to the writer or QA person for the calendar asking them to ensure this is
closed and they have made their necessary task notes.

Step 6: Open the Schedule Social Posts task and click the Open calendar button within that
task to access Social Marketing.

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/97.png)

Step 7: Make sure you are in the correct month in Social Marketing's calendar view and then
you can start scheduling! Select the date you want to schedule your post on. Unless the
drafting doc indicates a specific date in the Date column, you can pick any day within the

corresponding week of posts. Just make sure there are no notes in the drafting doc that
indicate this business wants things scheduled on certain days of the week. If there is a note
about this, please follow it. Also, please vary the days you are choosing so it's not always the
same days of the week selected. Once you select the date, the post composer will open!

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/98.png)

FOR THIS SECTION, PLEASE FOLLOW "NOT EXTENDED REACH" OR "EXTENDED REACH"
INSTRUCTIONS BASED ON YOUR NEEDS

NOT EXTENDED REACH:

Step 8: Copy and paste the post from the drafting doc into the Content box. Make sure the
correct platforms are selected.

Step 9: If a link is included, paste it into the SM link shortener field or paste it into the Content
box and click the "shorten links" button that will pop up.

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/99.png)

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/100.png)

Step 10: If the image(s) included with the post is a Google Drive image, download it and then
drag and drop the downloaded image into the Media section of the composer. If the file is too
large, crop the original image then copy and paste it into the Content box. If the image is from
a website (e.g.: Pexels, Unsplash, business website), you can simply copy and paste the image
into the Content box. Please note: if the image is too large, you can go ahead and crop it. For
Instagram, please make sure the image is a square shape—you can also crop for this purpose.

IF THEY HAVE EXTENDED REACH:

Step 8: The calendar will look something like the image below with different platforms
indicated for each post. Each platform should have the same image so start by inserting the
image. If the image(s) included with the post is a Google Drive image, download it and then
drag and drop the downloaded image into the Media section of the composer. If the file is too
large, crop the original image then copy and paste it into the Content box. If the image is from
a website (e.g.: Pexels, Unsplash, business website), you can simply copy and paste the image
into the Content box. Please note: if the image is too large, you can go ahead and crop it. For
Instagram, please make sure the image is a square shape—you can also crop for this purpose.

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/101.png)

Step 9: Once the image is added, click the Customize by account button in the composer. Make
sure the correct platforms are selected.

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/102.png)

Step 10: Copy and paste the content for each platform into their corresponding content boxes.

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/103.png)

PROCESS FROM HERE IS THE SAME FOR BOTH EXTENDED REACH AND NO EXTENDED REACH:

Step 11: Once the post, image, and any necessary links are all inserted into the composer, pick
a time for the post to be scheduled. Make sure posts are going out within normal business
hours for the business's time zone. Please vary the times you are choosing as well so they are
not all going out at the same time of day.

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/104.png)

Step 12: If the post has GBP included, please make sure to include a CTA in the CTA field. This
would mean either selecting Learn More and inserting a link or selecting Call Now. The
drafting doc will indicate whether it should be a link or a Call Now.

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/105.png)

Step 13: If the business uses clickable.bio for Instagram, this will be indicated in the drafting
doc and Instagram posts will have links included. Insert the link indicated into the Instagram
options section in the composer.

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/106.png)

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/107.png)

Step 14: If everything in the post preview looks good, go ahead and click Schedule post.
Continue this process for the rest of the calendar posts.

Step 15: Once all posts are scheduled, go into the Scheduled Posts tab in Social Marketing and
give the posts a quick proof to ensure everything looks good.

FOR THIS SECTION, PLEASE FIND THE APPROVAL TYPE YOU REQUIRE

APPROVAL THROUGH PLATFORM:

Step 16: If your calendar looks good, you can now close Social Marketing and return to Task
Manager. In the Schedule Social Posts task, leave task notes like the ones below. Mark the task
Complete.

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/108.png)

Step 17: Open the Client Review task and leave task notes like the ones below. Click the Send
for review button and once you get the pop_up message stating it was sent successfully, mark
the task Complete.

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/109.png)

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/110.png)

MANUAL APPROVAL:

Step 17: If the calendar has the Manual Approval box checked off in the WordNerdz Lifeline
like the ones below, make sure to send through this process. Once all your posts are
scheduled and proofed in Social Marketing, in the Calendar view, select the "Create Report"
button in the top right corner.

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/111.png)

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/112.png)

Step 18: In the box that will pop up, make sure you indicate if you have Drafts, Scheduled
posts, or both. Select the date range your calendar covered. Then click the Create report
button and in the new pop up, click the icon that looks like two pieces of paper to copy the link.

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/113.png)

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/114.png)

Step 19: Close Social Marketing and return to Task Manager and leave task notes in the
Schedule Social Posts task like the ones below. Mark the task Complete.

Step 20: You will be sending the report link via email. If the business is a Verticals client, send
the email to verticals@yourdigitalagents.com. If it's an Agency client, send the email to
agency@yourdigitalagents.com. If it's a High_Velocity client, send the email to
highvelocity@yourdigitalagents.com. You can see which cohort the business belongs to by
looking at the far left column in our lifeline. In all cases, CC: wordnerdz@yourdigitalagents.
com so the Social team can track these emails. The subject line should say: Attn: COMMS TEAM

MEMBER _ PID SMB Month Social Calendar. If you have the COMMs team member's name, fill
that in. If not, address it to their team. Fill in the PID, SMB, and calendar month. Give them the
link in the body of the email!

Step 21: Fill in the task notes like the ones below for the Client Review task and mark the task
Complete. DO NOT click the Send for Review button if it has one.

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/116.png)

NON_APPROVAL

Step 17: If the calendar says No Approval in the WordNerdz Lifeline as indicated below, follow

this process. Once you have finished scheduling all posts and they are proofed, you can now
close Social Marketing and return to Task Manager. Leave task notes in the Schedule Social
Posts task like the ones below. Mark the task Complete.

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/117.png)

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/118.png)

THE PROCESS FROM HERE IS THE SAME FOR ALL APPROVAL TYPES

Step 22: Once the scheduling project is complete, return to the drafting doc and turn the
calendar posts to black. Leave your initials in the Poster column.

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/119.png)

Step 23: Return to the WordNerdz Lifeline and change the status to Complete. You're done!

## PRBS: 'Legacy vs Regular (New) Accounts'

Legacy:

• These accounts were brought in at the very beginning (back in April 2022).

• They often deactivate and reactivate due to being non_responsive to PRBS, having no

accounts connected, or late on payment.

• They are the majority of the packages you will see in the PRBS LL

• Basic, Basic 2, &
 (These are all the exact same package, just located in
Basic 3

separate tabs within the drafting docs because they have the highest number of

accounts)

• Standard

• Pro

• Hard Start

• We
 post to GMB for these accounts.
NEVER

• Extended reach for PRBS is simply checking off what's connected in SM. We do not

optimize for different accounts.

• If they have no platforms connected in SM or only have GMB connected, we mark them

as No Credentials in the LL and the drafting doc. We DO NOT schedule these as drafts.

These will later be moved to a tab called "No Credentials" (Note: No account should

solely be located in the No Credentials tab. It should only be moved into this tab after we

have confirmed nothing is connected, with a note in the regular spot stating it has been

moved over.)

Since these clients don't know we have taken over writing for them, they don't always

want to reshare their credentials with PRBS as they don't understand why they would

need to).

• Before we move these accounts into the No Credentials tab we need to make sure

every month that they still have nothing connected (as they will connect things

without informing the Comms team). If we get access to a platform we can begin

posting for them ourselves the following month. If it hasn't been used, we'll begin

scheduling their posts for the current month immediately.

Regular (New Accounts):

• These are brand new accounts that have never been with PRBS before, and as such, are

treated like our regular accounts.

• They will ALWAYS be the 1x week package.

• These accounts CAN get GMB.

• Extended reach for PRBS is simply checking off what's connected in SM. We do not

optimize for different accounts.

• If one of these accounts has no credentials, we will treat them the way we do with any

other PID and save the posts as drafts. If they get approval, we will send the report to

the Assigned person (Deneeth Kumar) so they can still get approval from the client.

## How to setup Instagram Clickable.bio

https://www.loom.com/share/c42339b37f6e4aa291abbaf555e41bf9

Why does it matter what accounts are specified
under Extended Reach vs. the "primary" platform?

As you may have noticed, posts to different social platforms follow different formats.

For Instagram, hashtags are heavily used. For Twitter, captions need to be shortened due to
the minimal character limit.

With the products Social Posts 1x/week & Extended Reach, specifying what social platforms
are under each offering, specify how the Social Team caters the posts to those accounts.

For example:

• 123Socks is a client that wants social posts to Instagram, Facebook, and Google Business
Profile. They have Social Posts 1x/week & Extended Reach active.

• On their order form and during their onboard call, they specified that they want
Instagram as the
platform, and Facebook and GBP included under
primary
Extended
.
Reach

• When the Social Team goes to write posts for 123Socks, they will make the post with
Instagram as the primary platform in mind.

• This means that hashtags will and captions will be curated with Instagram's best posting
practices in mind. This identical post will then be published on Facebook and GBP, with a
slightly adjusted caption to suit each platform (ex. no hashtags for the GMB post.)

That being said, the caption won't be curated for Facebook (engagement focused) and GBP
(call to action focused.) as neither Facebook nor GBP are the
 platform. They just get a
primary
copy of the Instagram post.

NOTE: We do NOT do Extended Reach to Pinterest or Houzz.

When chosen as the primary platform, here is what the posts will look like:

Primary platform: Facebook:

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/123.png)

• Facebook: FB typically doesn't like redirecting people to other sites, so these posts would
be centered around engagement (increasing reactions & comments on the post.)

Primary platform: Instagram:

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/124.png)

• Instagram: hashtags, customized to each post.) No link included as Instagram captions
don't hyperlink URLs. May point towards the "link in bio" instead.

Primary platform: Google Business Profile:

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/125.png)

• GBP: Link to website or a call to action button can be utilized. Although, linking to an
external resource isn't recommended for GBP.

## Best Practices for Social Media

Each social media platform has its own unique features and best practices. Here are some
general guidelines for each of the platforms you mentioned:

1. Instagram:

• Visual content is key: Post high_quality photos and videos that align with your

brand's aesthetic.

• Use relevant hashtags: Research and include hashtags that are popular and

relevant to your content.

• Engage with your audience: Respond to comments, like posts, and interact with

followers to build a community.

• Utilize stories and IGTV: Take advantage of Instagram's features like stories and

IGTV to diversify your content.

2. LinkedIn:

• Professional content: Share industry news, insights, and thought leadership

content.

• Network strategically: Connect with professionals in your industry and engage

with their content.

• Participate in groups: Join and participate in relevant LinkedIn groups to expand

your network and establish yourself as an authority in your field.

• Utilize LinkedIn Pulse: Publish articles on LinkedIn Pulse to showcase your

and polls to keep your audience engaged.

• Utilize Facebook Groups: Create or participate in groups related to your industry

to foster community and engagement.

• Utilize Facebook Live: Use Facebook Live to interact with your audience in real_

time and showcase behind_the_scenes content.

is accurate and up_to_date, including your address, phone number, website, and

business hours.

month

How to find the updated content and strategy call
list every month

It's very important for the comms team to check which accounts have this product active to
make sure no account gets missed while when sending the content and strategy call email.
This step can be a bit tedious but is surely helpful to make sure nothing falls through the
cracks. Reminder that we need to send out the content and strategy call reminder and
booking link in the first 5 business days of every month and our goal should be to have the call
booked by the 10th of each month. The best practice I would say is to send out the call
booking reminder in the first two business days of each month.

Step 1: Go to
VMKA

Step 2: Filter by Open and Accounts (Add all your PIDs in the filter and this is where it gets a bit
tedious).

Step 3: In the search bar on top, type "Book content & strategy call" and you'll see all the
accounts (from the PIDs you have added) with that product open will appear. As shown in the
screenshot below:

Step 4: Please note that, this will be assigned to the "Content Team", please assign the task to
yourself and send the emails for the partners/client to book an appointment with you.

Extended Reach add_on gives your client the option to publish every post on as many
platforms as they want.

This is an add_on product with social post. We will be posting exact same social post on the
different social channels. In certain instances, we may make small tweaks like removing the
link on Instagram posts or reducing the number of hashtags for Facebook posts. It's perfect
for businesses that don't need unique posts on each social media platform but want to reach
as many people as possible.

We will be able to post on the below social media platforms:

• Facebook

• Instagram

• Google Business Profile

• LinkedIn

• Twitter (aka X)

This service doesn't include creating social pages.

Check out this

Guru card
 to learn the difference between the "Primary" platform and the
platforms specified in the Extended reach, and how the post formats will differ based on the
primary platform specified.

## Script/Tips for Escalation Calls:

In the moment when you are the phone with a partner or client and they are expressing their
frustration it is vital to hear them out, takeaway as much information and possible to be able
to provide a resolution in an authentic and professional way.

• Hear them out! A lot of the times if they are frustrated they just want to rant. Listen to
them vent and when you think they are done speaking wait
 before you begin
 3 seconds
speaking. If they start speaking again then they aren't done ranting, let them get it all
out so we don't talk over and keep walking in a circle explaining they're frustrations.

• Always remain calm, engaged and professional with proper body language (if cameras
are on) and active listening skills (nodding your head in understanding)

• Take ownership of the problem, apologize for the inconvenience and make them feel
like you truly want to fix the mistake made

• Listen to their concern, reiterate your understanding of what needs to be fixed and
provide an appropriate and feasible solution to the problem

• Provide specific timelines of when you follow_up/action the manners discussed

• Phrases to use "I understand your concern" "I apologize for the inconvenience" "We are
going to do our very best to ensure this is corrected" "Thank you for your patience"

## Comms _ Helping to Draft Social Calendars

1. Before committing to help the social team draft social calendars, please ensure that
your own responsibilities have been seen to, and that no one on your team needs
assistance.
Open the
.
Wordnerdz Lifeline

Click on the Filter Views dropdown arrow on the toolbar:

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/131.png)

5. Scroll down and select the "X| Helpers" filter.
Find a calendar with the "Needs Drafting" status and change it to "In Progress", then
put your first name and last initial in the Assigned Writer column.

6. Based on which PID the selected calendar is for, open the corresponding Drafting Doc

sheet:

![](/img/guru/MS-Core-Services/132.png)

9. Select the correct PID from the tabs on the bottom of the sheet.
Scroll to the right until you find the business that you're looking for.
Get a sense of the business before you start to write:

Read the Content Doc to get an understanding of the business and what they
are expecting for their social media posts.
Take note of the number of posts, and the platform(s) they will be going out
on.
Start writing the calendar!

    b. 10. a.

Write the body of the posts in the Content column. The number of characters
will be automatically tracked in the Count column (if you go over Twitter's
character limit, the Content cell will turn red)

    b. Choose an image and put the link in the Image column. Images are either
provided by the business in their content doc or drawn from one of our many
free stock photo resources (don't choose any premium of + images with
watermarks). Here are a few of them:

https://www.pexels.com/
https://unsplash.com/
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1C8SWVDlP2vpYq6_wk_
81l8sWA4YJjpl9
If your post includes a link (to a page on their website, an article/blog post,
etc), put the link in the Full Link column.

    iii. c. Once you've finished drafting a post, put your initials in the Initial column.
If a post needs to go out on a specific date (Christmas, New Years Day,
International Sandwich Day, etc), but the date number in the Date column.
If there are any Custom Images, put the link in the Custom Image Column.
Once the month's calendar has been drafted, go back to the Wordnerdz Lifeline and
change the calendar's status from "In Progress" to "Needs Proofing".

11. And there you have it! You've just helped our wonderful social team out! Rinse and repeat for
as long as you have the capacity to do so!

Scheduling:

There are 5 different packages within PRBS, each of which will be under Approvals or Non_
Approvals

• To get to the drafting docs from the LL, go to the Textbroker Docs tab at the bottom of

the LL. Every month will have an Approvals and Non_Approvals Doc. Look for the current

month we are scheduling for (should be
) and choose based on the
highlighted green

approval status of the calendar you are scheduling for.

• Approvals:

• Basic (1_3) _ 8 posts per month. Post to any account that is connected in SM, except

for GMB & LI

• Standard _ 14 posts per month. Post to any account that is connected in SM, except

for GMB & LI

• Pro _ 20 posts per month. Post to any account that is connected in SM, except for

GMB & LI

• Hard Start _ 12 posts per month. Post to any account that is connected in SM, except

for GMB & LI

• 1x week _ 4 posts per month. Post to what is stated in the order form/drafting doc.

These accounts CAN get GMB and LI if requested.

• Gets a client review task and should be sent for review through the platform.

• Non_Approvals:

• The exact same packages as Approvals, and same processes.

• Does Not get a client review task and should not be sent for approval in any.

• If no accounts in SM are connected, or only GMB is connected for any package that is not

1x week, DO NOT schedule the calendar. Mark as No Credentials in the LL and at the

bottom of the drafting doc.

• If no credentials for 1x week, schedule as drafts and send a report to

, and inform them that accounts are not
eliteteam@yourdigitalagents.com

connected. Once completed mark as Scheduled—No Credentials in the LL.

• We do not optimize posts for different platforms, EVER.

• Always check the content doc to make sure new content has been used. If not, make

sure to change things out before scheduling.

• Once everything has been scheduled and sent for approval (if required), mark the status

in the LL as Completed.

New Accounts:

PRBS has Legacy Accounts and Brand New Accounts. Legacy Accounts are the ones that came
in at the very start, they include: Basic (1_3), Standard, Pro, and Hard Start. Brand New
Accounts that we are currently getting for the first time go into Social 1x week.

• New Account _ Will always be under package Social 1x week. These accounts can get

GMB. The most important thing we need to know for new accounts is what their

approval status is. If this is not stated anywhere, we cannot add them to the drafting

docs or write for them until we get that info.

• *Important Note: Since PRBS is posts per month, not posts per week, we can write

/schedule an entire calendar in one or two weeks if need be. (This is still contingent

on giving them 5 day approval if they are an Approval calendar. Non_Approval

calendars don't need the 5 day window and can be scheduled for the same day if

necessary). It is also important that we add this new account not only in the month

we are currently in (if there's enough approval time in the month still), but also the

following month, otherwise this calendar will be missed since each month is a

completely separate month.

• Ex: It's July 20 and we just got an onboard for a new account in. We would draft

this RR for July only and schedule the posts for the following week. We would

then need to add this calendar into the August docs as well!

• Cancellation _ We don't have to do anything for Cancellation. Just solve the Ticket.

• Deactivation _ We don't have to do anything for Deactivation. Just solve the Ticket.

• Reactivation _ When it is a reactivation we just need to ask the PR team or the client if we

need to use the same content or just go for a new content.

## PRBS _ Listings and Comms GMB/GBP Workflow

Hey folks!

We are implementing new changes to improve client service by addressing an efficiency gap
that reduces the need for extensive client communication, which often hinders our operations
and creates confusion for end users. These changes aim to streamline processes and enhance
efficiency through self_service tools, clear documentation, proactive communication,
standardized processes, project management tools, clear communication channels, and
empowering client_facing teams. These measures will allow us to serve clients more effectively
while reducing unnecessary communication and potential delays, ensuring a better overall
experience for our clients and end users.

 email and add PR.

assign them to VIP Communication Team (Faruk) as usual, informing them of what are

the next steps

• The VIP Communications Team will then send a follow_up to the client via email in

question to inform them of the next steps (so they are aware this isn't any type of scam)

and ensure that they know that we will be claiming and verifying the listing via phone

call, SMS, email, video or need business documentation to escalate to Google.

• Email allows for the client to see it coming from the branded email we are also

requesting management/ownership from

• Once the VIP Communications Team has followed up with the client via email and call for

4 times and the client is still unresponsive, VIP Communication Team will close out the

project and they'll assign the task back to the Listings Team so that they can keep tabs

on the request for access.

• If the VIP Communication Team is successful in reaching the client and they have sent or

completed everything we requested, the VIP Communication Team will put notes on

VTM and assign it back to the Listing Team so that they can complete the necessary task.

• Once the VIP Communications Team has completed the verification, they will assign the

task back to the Listings Team, who will complete their regular NAP check making sure

everything from Business Description to services is approved by Google.

the request after 3 business days. As part of this appeal process, Google will give the

option to verify the listing by phone call, SMS, email, or video.

• The Listings Team will notify the VIP Communications Team in the task notes about

which options are offered, then assign the task to them

• The VIP Communications Team will then connect with the client to complete the

verification

• The Listings Team will be able to add the PR. Business location group to the listing at

this point, making the listing viewable from any Marketing Services account

• Once the VIP Communications Team has completed the verification, they will assign the

task back to the Listings Team, who will complete their regular NAP check making sure

everything from Business Description to services is approved by Google.

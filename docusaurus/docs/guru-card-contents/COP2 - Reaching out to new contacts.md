# COP2 Reaching out to new contacts

COP2 is the partner, and the 'clients' are their different locations most of which do not know that the 
company subcontracts us. They are sometimes untrusting of the emails we send to them so we have 
been instructed to do the following when reaching out – Ref ticket #443544

The below is what we can send to the property manager (approved by Dakota 05/14/2024)

You can find this in a macro called '

COP2 Information'

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to provide you with some information regarding the 
Co-op Profile Application (CPA) and its integration with Google My Business (GMB).

A Summary

Local Co-ops utilize the Co-op Profile Application (CPA), accessible through the internal 
website known as The Hub, to manage location information as well as details about the 
respective CO OP such as contacts and board of directors. This data is not only propagated 
to several of the internal platforms but, if opted in, is also transmitted via API to the system 
that I use Partner Centre (PC). This facilitates the creation of accounts within Partner Centre 
for us to oversee and manage the connection point to Google My Business.

Managing your own GMB Listing

It's worth noting that some local co ops prefer to independently manage their Google My 
Business presence without relying on our data synchronization. In such cases, we can 
accommodate their preference. This is something you need to do on your end by ceasing 
the transmission of data from CPA to PC. However, it's important to understand that this 
action applies universally and cannot be implemented at a per property level. Consequently, 
if a local co op chooses to opt out of our data sync for Google My Business, they will also 
forfeit access to data updates for other properties, not just their GMB listing.

More information

Furthermore, to maintain brand consistency across the Co-operative Retailing System (CRS), 
Federated Co-operatives Limited (FCL) provides standard naming conventions for local co 
ops to adhere to on Google My Business. For instance, the listing name should reflect "Co-op 
Liquor" rather than using specific co op names like "Southland Co-op Liquor." Here is more

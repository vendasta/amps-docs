# If the partner wants to pause, all spend going towards the Google Ads campaign while we wait to get payment from the client on our end, and they don't want to cancel anything fully.

If the partner wants to pause, all spend going towards
the Google Ads campaign while we wait to get
payment from the client on our end, and they don't
want to cancel anything fully.

If the partner doesn't want to spend until the client pays him. We recommend pausing the campaign
and ask the partner to cancel the product. Partner can reactivate once they get payment from their
client.

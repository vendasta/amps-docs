## Listings Flow Chart

Purpose:
This flow chart linked below outlines the step by step process for claiming Google listings
using an "If This, Then That" format. It is designed to help the Client Engagement team better
understand the processes involved on both the Fulfillment and Client Engagement sides. By
highlighting key decision points and potential nuances, this guide provides insight into what
Client Engagement can expect when working with Google listings and what specific
information they may need to gather in advance.

Objective:
The goal is to streamline communication between Listings and Client Engagement teams by
providing a clear visual of each step, reducing unnecessary back and forth, and enabling more
efficient responses to clients. This will lead to faster resolutions and improved customer
satisfaction.

How it Works:

• Step by Step Guide: The flow chart breaks down each action required to claim a Google

listing, with corresponding "If this, then that" logic to illustrate potential outcomes.

• Clarifying Expectations: By understanding the different scenarios and information

required at each stage, Client Engagement will be better prepared to manage client

expectations and gather necessary details upfront.

• Reducing Communication Gaps: This visual tool minimizes misunderstandings between

teams, enhancing overall efficiency in resolving client inquiries related to Google listing

claims.

This Guru Card empowers Client Engagement to proactively address client needs and quickly
resolve any issues, that are in their control, related to Google listing claims.

Script & Process

Hello! Thank you for joining me today! I'm excited to get your website set up with InboxPro AI
today. Before we go ahead and do so, I want to take you through the benefits of this product.

As I'm sure you already know, effective communication and lead management are crucial for
building strong client relationships in today's market. Small and medium sized businesses
(SMBs) rely on quick responses and real time engagement. However, agencies often face
challenges managing multiple communication channels, monitoring leads, and responding
promptly on your behalf. Capturing and tracking leads across platforms can be time intensive
and prone to errors.

Sell Them on the AI Tool

Vendasta's Inbox Pro isn't just a communication tool—it's a comprehensive solution that
integrates seamlessly with AI powered chatbots. This integration allows agencies to engage
visitors on their clients' websites in real time, capturing leads effortlessly. Leads are
automatically synchronized with the CRM, eliminating manual data entry and ensuring every
interaction is tracked and followed up.

Leads are automatically fed into the CRM, creating contacts without any manual input.

Today, we are going to activate our Inbox Pro AI tool on your account, for FREE, get it onto
your website, and then train the AI to make it extra intelligent. You'll be able to watch it go
from a baseline understanding, based on the information it can find on the first page of your
website to answering much more context questions that may have answers throughout the
rest of your website. Lastly, I'll walk you through how it connects to our CRM and how you will
know what conversations the AI is having with your potential customers.

going to add it right to the CRM for you, which I'll take you through later. Before we move on,
important to mention that the AI has upwards of 150 languages, so if someone doesn't know
what it's saying they can ask it to switch to their language. Moving on, now we are going to

to be cancelled by Directwest and the new one ordered). Directwest will email the renewal
CRM form to digitalteam@directwest.com. Once received:

• Acknowledge receipt by replying to Directwest.

• Look at the CRM and update the information in the Directwest lifeline (new campaign

end date, any spend change, etc), and in VTM account notes, if applicable. Make sure to

check the form for any notes about ad content requests.

• Using the same ticket that the renewal came in on, write an internal note to Jackie

informing her of the renewal, the new campaign timeline, and any requests that the

client may have made for their new ad.

• Wherever possible, keep the client on the same 3 month update cadence that they were

on before.

Terminations

Terminations are now taken care of by Directwest. They will cancel the products, so we need to
ensure on our that our spend cycles have completed or come to a halt.

• Look at the end date

• Create an internal ticket to Jackie S with the business name(s)

• Mention the end date in the email as a cancelation notice due to lack of renewal and

Jackie will ensure the account runs out of spend within the month or an immediate halt.

• Set Jackie as the Assignee and set the ticket as open

• Jackie S. will ensure spend stops and we will leave everything as is until a renewal

appears

• Copy the business name in the Lifeline into the Cancelations Tab under the month it will

cancel

Digital Advertising Comm Steps

STEP 1

• Ensure new cadence is updated in the
Lifeline

• New orders are added

• Terminations are separated from Continuing Campaigns

• Move the new cadence to the top of the Lifeline

STEP 2

• All First Calls must be done before the 5th of the month

• Call business lines, and cell phones on file from the client

• Goal: mention the 3 month ad update and work towards new ideas for the next 3

months

• If the account is Hiromi's (MA) then double check to see if they already have creatives

for each cadence. She will work on a full year for her clients at times'

• If the account is Gord's (MA) we will often work directly with him on ad updates for

his accounts. Contact Gord first.

• Update all tasks associated with First Calls in VMKA

• Update Lifeline with the correct colour association

• Update the Lifeline with the date you reached out to the client

• See the legend at the top left of the Lifeline for guidance

STEP 3

• All First Emails must be complete by the 10th of each month

• Send the No Contact Made email Macro to the client

• Update the Lifeline with the date you reached out to the client

STEP 4

• All Second Calls must be completed by the 15th of the month

• This calls tends to be a follow up call to the email previously send

• If the client does not respond to this call, the next step is to flag with their MA to

keep the clients on their toes.

• Update Lifeline with the correct colour association

• Update the Lifeline with the date you reached out to the client

• See the legend at the top left of the Lifeline for guidance

STEP 5

• If at any of these stages the client works with you to provide any ideas you will make

note of that in the VTM tasks you are completing.

• You will then create an internal ticket with Jackie S. (our ad specialist)

• Subject Header is the business name and the month you are updating

• Business YXE   July Ad Update

• Add the new ideas and potential creative assets shared with you

• Jackie S. will reassign the internal ticket to you once the ad has been created and you will

turn the internal ticket into a public reply and shift the requester to the client and send

the
macro as we look for
New Campaign Launch Email & Ad Update Build Complete

approval.

• Update VTM

STEP 6

• We will follow up with the client every 2 days for approval until we near the end of the

month.

• Call and email

• Flag with the MA after 3 attempts to get their input on the situation.

• Update the Lifeline with the dates, and checkbox and colours associated with where

you are at.

• Once approved, send the ticket back to Jackie S. with an internal note stating the

approval of the ad

• If there are edits prior to the ad going live go back and forth with Jackie S. in this

ticket to allow a single thread of work to be visible to others who may assist you.

THE GOAL:

• Go from first call to a new ad live in the shortest amount of time possible.

• We look forward to 80% ads live every month at a minimum.

• Clients will sometimes want to keep the same ad, this counts.

NOTES:

• New ads coming in take first priority

• We don't take care of the ordering or the cancelations in PC, just ensure that we don't

spend when they shouldn't be spending

• Update the Lifeline and VTM constantly to ensure over. communication and tracking for

insurance purposes

• If by the end of the month the client has been unresponsive and the MA hasn't been

responsive as well, I send a last minute email.

• State that as they haven't provided a new ad idea for us to create for them we will be

running their previous ad for another 3 months. This will either wake them up or

keep them informed that they will have an ad running still.

New Orders

If a new campaign comes in here are the steps you need to take:

• Process the activation as per normal, gathering the following information:

• Budget

• Contract Start Time (this is when we connect with the client)

• Length of Ad Campaign

• Customer ID (Jackie needs to add this to the ad in MC)

• Notes and Ad Creatives may be shared for your convenience

• With Directwest's ads, we don't use specialist tickets, and all communication should take

place in a single ticket per account (Internal notes to Jackie Shorten, Public replies to the

client, MA, DW, etc)

• You will need to add the business and the information to the right cadence in the
Lifeline

• Sent the internal ticket to Jackie S with the information needed as well so she knows the

important information for MC when the ad can go live

• Once you connect with the client, you may need Facebook Access—work on that when

you connect for their “onboard”

• Work with the client on new ad ideas, creatives, etc and we will give them a 1 3 business

day SLA before we send the ad for their approval

• We do not create an ad if we don't have their Facebook Page in our Business

Manager (we've ran into too many problems doing it through Digital Agency)

Partner are having issue as they don't have any social product active but still their Facebook
profile photo is getting changed automatically,

The reason your Facebook profile picture is getting changed automatically is due to the
intended functionality of the platform.

have uploaded your logo picture in the media section, any updates or changes made to the
logo in the media section will be automatically reflected in the corresponding Facebook photo.

changes to the logo. The synchronization feature ensures that your Facebook page stays up to 
date and consistent with your brand identity.

Email Etiquette

1. Include a clear, direct subject line.

Examples of a good subject line include, "Meeting date changed," "Quick question about your
presentation," or "Suggestions for the proposal."

"People often decide whether to open an email based on the subject line," Pachter says.
"Choose one that lets readers know you are addressing their concerns or business issues."

2. Use a professional email address.

If you work for a company, you should use your company email address. But if you use a
personal email account  whether you are self employed or just like using it occasionally for
work related correspondences  you should be careful when choosing that address, Pachter
says.

You should always have an email address that conveys your name so that the recipient knows
exactly who is sending the email. Never use email addresses (perhaps remnants of your grade 
school days) that are not appropriate for use in the workplace, such as "babygirl@..." or
"beerlover@..."  no matter how much you love a cold brew.

3. Think twice before hitting "Reply all."

No one wants to read emails from 20 people that have nothing to do with them. Ignoring the
emails can be difficult, with many people getting notifications of new messages on their
smartphones or distracting pop up messages on their computer screens. Refrain from hitting
"Reply All" unless you really think everyone on the list needs to receive the email, Pachter says.

4. Include a signature block.

Provide your reader with some information about you, Pachter suggests. "Generally, this

would state your full name, title, the company name, and your contact information, including a
phone number. You also can add a little publicity for yourself, but don't go overboard with any
sayings or artwork."

Use the same font, type size, and color as the rest of the email, she says.

5. Use professional salutations.

Don't use laid back, colloquial expressions like, "Hey you guys," "Yo," or "Hi folks."

"The relaxed nature of our writings should not affect the salutation in an email," she says. "Hey
is a very informal salutation and generally it should not be used in the workplace. And Yo is
not okay either. Use Hi or Hello instead."

She also advises against shortening anyone's name. Say, "Hi Michael," unless you're certain he
prefers to be called "Mike."

6. Use exclamation points sparingly.

If you choose to use an exclamation point, use only one to convey excitement, Pachter says.

"People sometimes get carried away and put a number of exclamation points at the end of
their sentences. The result can appear too emotional or immature," she writes. "Exclamation
points should be used sparingly in writing."

7. Be cautious with humor.

Humor can easily get lost in translation without the right tone or facial expressions. In a
professional exchange, it's better to leave humor out of emails unless you know the recipient
well. Also, something that you think is funny might not be funny to someone else.

Pachter says: "Something perceived as funny when spoken may come across very differently
when written. When in doubt, leave it out."

8. Know that people from different cultures speak and write differently.

Miscommunication can easily occur because of
, especially in the writing
cultural differences
form when we can't see one another's body language. Tailor your message to the receiver's
cultural background or how well you know them.

A good rule to keep in mind, Pachter says, is that high context cultures (Japanese, Arab, or
Chinese) want to get to know you before doing business with you. Therefore, it may be
common for business associates from these countries to be more personal in their writings.
On the other hand, people from low context cultures (German, American, or Scandinavian)
prefer to get to the point very quickly.

9. Reply to your emails  even if the email wasn't intended for you.

It's difficult to reply to every email message ever sent to you, but you should try to, Pachter
says. This includes when the email was accidentally sent to you, especially if the sender is
expecting a reply. A reply isn't necessary but serves as good email etiquette, especially if this

person works in the same company or industry as you.

Here's an example reply: "I know you're very busy, but I don't think you meant to send this
email to me. And I wanted to let you know so you can send it to the correct person."

10. Proofread every message.

Your mistakes won't go unnoticed by the recipients of your email. "And, depending upon the
recipient, you may be judged for making them," Pachter says.

Don't rely on spell checkers. Read and reread your email a few times, preferably aloud, before
sending it off.

"One supervisor intended to write, 'Sorry for the inconvenience,'" Pachter says. "But he relied
on his spell check and ended up writing, 'Sorry for the incontinence.'"

11. Add the email address last.

"You don't want to send an email accidentally before you have finished writing and proofing
the message," Pachter says. "Even when you are replying to a message, it's a good precaution
to delete the recipient's address and insert it only when you are sure the message is ready to
be sent."

12. Double check that you've selected the correct recipient.

Pachter says to pay careful attention when typing a name from your address book on the
email's "to" line. "It's easy to select the wrong name, which can be embarrassing to you and to
the person who receives the email by mistake."

13. Keep your fonts classic.

Purple Comic Sans has a time and a place (maybe?). But for business correspondence, keep
your fonts, colors, and sizes classic.

The cardinal rule: Your emails should be easy for other people to read.

"Generally, it is best to use 10  or 12 point type and an easy to read font such as Arial, Calibri,
or Times New Roman," Pachter advises. As for color, black is the safest choice.

14. Keep tabs on your tone.

Just as jokes get lost in translation, tone is easy to misconstrue without the context you'd get
from vocal cues and facial expressions. Accordingly, it's easy to come off as more abrupt that
you might have intended: You meant "straightforward," they read "angry and curt."

To avoid misunderstandings, Pachter recommends you read your message out loud before

hitting send. "If it sounds harsh to you, it will sound harsh to the reader," she says.

For best results, avoid using unequivocally negative words ("failure," "wrong," "neglected"),
and always say "please" and "thank you."

15. Nothing is confidential  so write accordingly.

Always remember what former CIA chief General David Petraeus apparently forgot, warns
Pachter:
 electronic message leaves a trail.
Every

"A basic guideline is to assume that others will see what you write," she says, "so don't write
anything you wouldn't want everyone to see." A more liberal interpretation: Don't write
anything that would be ruinous to you or hurtful to others. After all, email is dangerously easy
to forward, and it's better to be safe than sorry.

What features are visible in VTM to partners
/clients?

In VTM, you may have noticed that some things are mentioned as being "visible in business
app" or "not visible in business app." You may have also wondered what "public" and "private"
means, and who is able to view it.

For VMKW/VMKS/VMKA projects, here is what
 can see via their PID
partners
in VTM:

Public Task Notes: Yes

Private Task Notes: Yes

Public Comments: Yes

Private Comments: Yes

Account Notes: Yes

Assignees: No

As a best practice, always use white label practices when leaving public/private notes,
comments, etc.

Ex: Referring to the partner as Jim instead of "partner"

But at least now you should have a better idea of what's actually being seen by partners and
clients! :)

What to do with Inbox Tickets

Inbox Tickets are automated and sent directly to Zendesk every time there is Inbox
communication within VTM.

Please make use of these tickets to keep track of the follow ups regarding the concern raised
through the inbox. Whenever a response comes, a new Zendesk ticket will be created.

![](/img/guru/MS-Communications/31.png)

Assign these tickets to the PID assignee.

Thank you!

How to Address Bulk Cancellation Tickets

You visited the triage and suddenly encountered a bunch of cancellation tickets within
minutes! You know these tickets require similar response and treatment.

So, instead of going in and addressing every ticket one by one, you can clear these tickets at
once.

Scenario 1: Website Cancellation

![](/img/guru/MS-Communications/32.png)

Step 1: Select all the similar tickets.

![](/img/guru/MS-Communications/33.png)

Step 2: Draft your response and submit as solved

Scenario 2 Blogs/Core Cancellation

Step 1: Select all the similar tickets.

Step 2: Assign to the PID owner.

Submit these tickets as
so they will reopen in the PID assignee's queue.

How to add assets your to project?

In any project, assets are the necessary piece of information without which tasks and the
service order on the whole cannot be completed. Example: Framework, Structure, Social Media
Account access, Media, etc.

It often happens during the onboarding calls that client/partner may not provide them right
and you might have to follow up. Once you receive them, here's how you can add them to the
project.

Step 1: Copy the AGID and open that account in
VMKW

![](/img/guru/MS-Communications/57.png)

Step 2: Find your project from 'View all projects'.

![](/img/guru/MS-Communications/58.png)

Step 3: Click on any task and look under Account Notes.

![](/img/guru/MS-Communications/59.png)

Step 4: Click on the 'Drive' and add your assets (images, videos, documents, etc.) to it.

Step 5: If the assets are for:

Core: Inform the team by creating an internal ticket.

Website: Create a VTM task for Website Support Request and inform the MS   Website
Support team via Zendesk. To double down, you can also inform the team under project
thread in Slack (you can search it using AGID in #ms   incoming channel).

Refer:

Creating Website Support Requests

Assigning correct Tier to Website Support Requests

Handling Tricky Partner Communication

You will often encounter tickets where partners reach out about missed service, delayed order
or complain about quality  of content delivered.

Here are a few tips that might come in handy.

• Send out a first response, saying something on lines of
 "Thank you for reaching out...we

are looking into this matter and get back to you once we have an update."

• Read the ticket carefully, find other tickets related to the matter.

• Locate the original order ticket and follow the trail to understand the issue.

• Examine the VTM and project to create
 ticket and assign
Website Support   Internal Note

it to Website Support.

• For Core: Generate an internal Zendesk ticket and clarify the issue with the team.

• Once you have an answer, send a response to partner including:

• Latest project status

• Summary of edits/issue

• Action plan

• Tentative timeline

• For complex scenarios/escalations, be sure to loop in your team lead, fulfillment

manager and PDM.

• CC the PDM in all emails.

• Add your TL and fulfilment manager as followers to your ticket.

![](/img/guru/MS-Communications/60.png)

• Offer a meeting option to partner if issue needs more clarity.

• Note that in missed/delayed order instances, fulfillment can offer certain incentives like

free social posts or free blog, but it is advisable to confirm such details before the

meeting.

• Send a post meeting emailing summarizing your discussion.

• Finally, document everything through internal notes.

Checking Partner/Client Contact Details on Partner

Center

Checking Partner/Client Contact Details on
Partner Center

Whether you are triaging in Zendesk, have a cancellation call coming up or simply sending a
blog, finding correct contact information and reaching the right person is very important.

Reason  We
 want to break white label!
DO NOT

Here's how you find the information:

1) Cancellation Call

Go to Partner Center and throw in the PID.

Search the Account with Order Cancellation using AGID/Name.

![](/img/guru/MS-Communications/61.png)

Click on the order form and check the info for primary partner for communications

Checking Partner/Client Contact Details on Partner

Center

![](/img/guru/MS-Communications/62.png)

![](/img/guru/MS-Communications/63.png)

2) Sending Blog

Go to the Blog Project in VTM.

Checking Partner/Client Contact Details on Partner

Center

Check the account notes in Task to check if any specific contact is mentioned.

![](/img/guru/MS-Communications/64.png)

If not, you can check an older Zendesk ticket for previous month's blog send and get the
email address.

If there is no older blog ticket, you can use the order form and send it to partner.

Usually partners respond with details of addressee if they want to loop in someone else.

3) Triaging

Check in Partner Center to find out who has sent the email.

If its the client, it is usually a good practice to loop in the partner as triage tickets can be
a continuation of ongoing issue.

Checking Partner/Client Contact Details on Partner

Center

If you do not recognize the address, you can search older Zendesk tickets and find out
which account, partner and client you are dealing with.

Fulfilment Team Can't Access Product Via Partner Center or

Business App. How Can You Help?

Fulfilment Team Can't Access Product Via Partner
Center or Business App. How Can You Help?

Our fulfilment teams need access to individual products like Social Marketing Pro, Reputation
Management, Listing Builder, etc. to complete the services and work on client/partner
feedback.

So, if a ticket falls into triage saying ATTN Anyone! You can be that anyone and help solve this
issue with one thing Marketing Services is known and meant for---Effective Communication.

Step 1: Check if you can access the product. Because it could be an individual facing as they
are not added as a user.

Step 2: If the product does not open via PC, try through Business App as well to double check.
The error can be something like this:

Fulfilment Team Can't Access Product Via Partner Center or

Business App. How Can You Help?

![](/img/guru/MS-Communications/65.png)

![](/img/guru/MS-Communications/66.png)

Step 3: If it's a partner account, you can share inform the Internal Support team via
support 

slack channel. They will create a ticket and work on the issue.
on demand

Remember, do not share just your ticket number or assign it to someone as this team has a
separate Zendesk setup.

Fulfilment Team Can't Access Product Via Partner Center or

Business App. How Can You Help?

They can share their ticket with you later and you can inform the fulfilment team later when
issue is fixed.

Step 4: If its a client account, send an email to
, from your
internalsupport@vendasta.com
Vendasta email ID.

Mention the PID, AGID, issue and the fact that its a client and all communications need to be
white labeled.

That way, they will reach out to you on the same email after fixing the problem and you can

communicate with partner/client.

Step 5: Inform the partner about this issue (keep PDM in CC) to keep them in the loop.

Step 6: When the issue is fixed, inform the fulfiment team via slack or internal Zendesk ticket.

Adding a user in Zendesk (Admin Only)

1. Go to the Admin Center in Zendesk and click on the People tab on the left hand side
Under team, click Team members
Click on the blue button 'add team member'
Enter the information for the new team member addition to Zendesk
Assign the role as an agent for the team member

Once they have been added they will have to go into their yourdigitalagents email to verify
and change the password.

6. Next, we have to add the new team member to the correct correct for tracking
purposes. They should first be included in the Marketing Services group. However,

Digital Ads: Facebook Insight Management Tips

Learning more about insights and how to properly execute them for the benefit of your clients
is always going to keep your retention rates higher, and lead to more prosperous campaigns
when you know what you're looking at. Below is a series of new information we can use as
Marketing Coordinators with the help of our Digital Ads Specialists.

Use this the next time you're working on Account Management Insights to see how well your
campaigns are performing!

TIPS:

• As a general rule of thumb if we are getting less than a $10 CPM we are in what I would

consider to be an acceptable range for a FB campaign.

• External factors (more competition, less interest, seasonality, etc) have a high likelihood

of impacting the CPM which is pretty common on Facebook.

• Keep in mind what the focus of the campaign is, whether it is Brand Awareness, Web

Traffic, etc. will determine how Facebook's algorithm will push your ad in front of people

to optimize itself for those results.

• i.e. If you have a web traffic focus on the ad it will care less about pushing for

Impressions, and it will care more about identifying places to increase people

clicking on their CTA

• Facebook targeting is also completely open and customizable you can lower your CPM at

by changing your Geo Targeting, Age, Demographic, and Interests for those who may be

more likely to click on the ad. There is also a larger likelihood to increase your numbers

without having these depending on your budget, some campaigns will generally do

better by having a more broad setting.

 https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/28/facebook advertising benchmarks

• These are relevant and helpful benchmarks for CTR and CPC metrics across the

board of multiple different industries

• For clicks campaigns, we would check out the top two metrics on that link (CTR & CPC) as

these two metrics will tell you if the number of clicks you are getting is competitive with

other advertisers based both on the number of impressions you're getting and based on

what you're spending.

Hopefully, this can help make more sense to the metrics we look at month to month!

Google Workspace Setup

1. We will receive the order in the work order and a New Service Request Email for the

product.

2. Create a new project for this order under VTM that AGID/SMB Account, using the

Google Workspace Setup Template:

3. Assign the Communications tasks to yourself (or the CSS assigned to that PID in case

you are processing the order for someone else).

3. Assign the domain specific tasks to Website Support.

![](/img/guru/MS-Communications/70.png)

3. Initiate Communication with the partner: Macro to be used   MS   Google Workspace

Setup Confirmation Email

4. Solve the New Service request email with the confirmation email ticket number and

mention that the Order has been processed in an internal note.

5. Once you receive the domain access, share the ticket with Website Support. The

turnaround would be 1 business day.

NOTE: Pay attention to any instructions left in the "Notes" sections in the above LL, as

there may be certain PIDs that require deviations from the below process

(ex: "Don't send confirmations to a client; send them as internal notes to

account manager or partner to cancel the product(s).

COMMUNICATIONS   BOUNCEBACK PROCESS

1. 1st Bounce Back

Follow up on the previous email with outstanding assets & a call. Leave a note in

the ticket & in VTM

Partner/Client wants to pause the project.

1. If they do not provide a date to restart: We will leave notes and close

the tasks in VTM, and update the Slack project thread. The Account

Manager will be notified in Slack. Please, recommend the cancellation

of the product to the Partner, and let them know that billing will

continue.

2. If they do provide a date to restart: Update VTM Tasks and ticket with

necessary date and note. Fulfillment teams should be notified as well

through necessary channels (email or slack). Notify Account Manager

of the choice indicated by the Partner.

If the Partner mentions they are waiting on a response from the client, ask

them for a timeline

If they respond, the project continues

If there is no response after 2 business days move to 2nd bounce back

2. 2nd Bounce Back

Call the Partner/Client. Leave a note in the ticket & VTM

If nobody answers, follow up on the ticket with a public response

Leave a note in the Partner's SSC. Include all necessary information

WORK ORDER

1. Close out the Work Order

2. If the Work Order needs to be closed out due to partner/client unresponsiveness, or a

request from the partner to pause the project, follow these steps:

Locate the original “Work Order Required” thread, that you previously created in

#ms support team via the automated Work Order Required slack workflow.

Add a response to that thread to provide an update, stating WHY the work is

being paused/closed out and include any applicable pertinent communication

from the partner. Be sure to specify that you're closing out the VTM project, etc.

Re tag the Vendasta Account Manager, Todd Roberts, your Team Lead or

Manager, and fulfillment manager.

Also include the next date you will be prompted to check into this (ex: 3

months during the next account check, etc.)

For products with recurring billing (Social posts 1x month, etc.) specify that

the partner will continue to be billed monthly unless this product is

canceled.

3. Locate the project in VTM. Add notes to the open tasks stating that you're closing it

out and the reason (ex: “Closing out due to unresponsiveness after 4 bouncebacks” or

“Closing out due to request from --- that was received in ticket #123456”. Mark the

tasks as completed to close out the project.

If they have asked you to pause it until a specific date, push all of the tasks due

dates to that specified date instead of closing out the project.

4. Go to the Work Orders Table and update the status to
Vendor Pause

5. Close out any applicable tickets in Zendesk. Leave an internal note linking the slack

link(s), VTM, and any applicable info regarding to why you're closing it out (ie. what

you posted in slack/VTM.)

Directwest   Listings / Comms GBAS Workflow

Hey there!

We are making some new and exciting changes to ensure we can serve our clients better, and
we noticed a gap in efficiency that we can now implement to ensure we do the work we need
to with less communication with the client which tends to slow down our operations and cause
confusion for the end user.

Goal:

• Centralizing Ownership:

• Own/Manage more listings through our digitalteam@directwest.com email

• Minimize Confusion:

• Communication with clients who are usually unaware of the individual emails created

a long time ago tends to become unhelpful to the progress of the re verification or

simply logging in.'

SO, what are the new steps?

• The Listings Team will do their typical GBAS Check Up

• If the Google account on file offers any problems (ie. 2FA, changed password, etc)

they will request Owner/Management to the listings from digitalteam@directwest.

com

• Fields:

• Level of access: Ownership

• Select one: I own/work for an agency that represents this business

• Name: Directwest

• Phone: 306 653 1210

• Agency name: Directwest

• The Listings Team will update the task notes for the Verticals Client Engagement Team

and assign them to Digital Team as usual, informing them of the request being sent

• The Verticals Client Engagement Team will then send a follow up to the client via email

in question to inform them of the request being sent (so they are aware this isn't any

type of scam) and ensure that they know that if the request isn't approved that we will

be claiming and verifying the listing via phone call, SMS, email, or video within the next 5

business days.

• Email allows for the client to see it coming from the branded email we are also

requesting management/ownership from

• Once the Verticals Client Engagement Team has sent the info to the client, they'll assign

the task back to the Listings Team so that they can keep tabs on the request for access.

• If the request for access is successful, the Listings Team will add the DW Fulfillment

location group to the listing and complete the GBAS check as usual

• It is not likely that the request for access will be successful, but it does occasionally

happen

• If the request for access is rejected or ignored, the Listings Team will be able to "appeal"

the request after 3 business days. As part of this appeal process, Google will give the

option to verify the listing by phone call, SMS, email, or video.

• The Listings Team will notify the Verticals Client Engagement Team in the task notes

about which options are offered, then assign the task to them

• The Verticals Client Engagement Team will then connect with the client to

complete the verification

• The Listings Team will be able to add the DW Fulfillment location group to the listing

at this point, making the listing viewable from any Marketing Services account

• Once the Verticals Client Engagement Team has completed the verification, they will

assign the task back to the Listings Team, who will complete their regular NAP check.

Verticals Communication Macro

Hi there!

We wanted to let you know that our Listings Management Team has recently requested access
to your Google listing as a part of our re verification methods. The email we had on file that
has access had some barriers to entry and this hurts our team's ability to continue serving you
and your listing. This request will be coming from our verified email digitalteam@directwest.
com, if you see this request please accept the invitation!

After three business days, the listing will be available for claiming and allow us to verify again
by phone call, SMS, email, or video, so you may hear from us over the phone to finish the
verification.

If you have any questions related to this, don't hesitate to reach out. As a reminder, this comes
at no extra cost as this is already a part of the management work we do for you.

Thanks,

Directwest Team

Listing Verification Process for MS Communication

Teams

Listing Verification Process for MS
Communication Teams

With the discontinuation of the vetted partners' Direct Verification program, manual
verifications are a necessary process when it comes to Google listing claims. Empowering
Communications team members to complete these verifications on their own will reduce the
need to coordinate multiple schedules and will allow these manual claims to happen at a
much quicker pace.

1. The Listings team will set up a listing so that it is accessible to anyone in the

"Marketing Services" Google organization.

2. The Listings team will assign the Comms team member a task (likely "Check for

Existing Listing" or "Claim and Verify Listing") in VMKA with an instruction to verify a

listing.

An example note might read "Mariel U 2023 06 07: Listing requires verification

via a phone code, please reach out to the client to complete this verification"'

3. The communications will then reach out to the Client or Partner depending on what is

in the Guru Card with a
 to complete the verification method Google has
booking link

given. I.e., walking them through getting to video verification, and pushing the phone

call through.

4. You will open business.google.com and search for the account that requires

verification.

![](/img/guru/MS-Communications/79.png)

5. Click "Get verified" on the right hand side of the page.

A new screen will load. If you see a message asking "Is this your business?" do a

quick check to ensure that the businesses don't match, then click "This doesn't

match" and hit confirm

The Listings team will have already investigated this, so in most cases the

businesses won't match. But if the businesses ARE the same, reach out to

the Listings team member for next steps.

see several options here. Select the one you want, then hit Next.

"Phone code" gives you the option to push through an automated code from

Google to the phone number on the listing. This can be in the form of a phone

call or a text message. (Call codes will be good for up to half an hour; text codes

will be good for up to 10 minutes.) Important: selecting Next from this screen

Teams

will push the call or text through, so do not do this until you're sure the client is

ready to receive it.

"Email code" will push an automated code from Google to an email address at

. You cannot enter a different email address in this
the listed website domain

field. (Email verification codes last anywhere between "24 hours and 30 days").

Teams

Important: selecting Next from this screen will push the email through, so do not

do this until you're sure the client is ready to receive it.

"Postcard code" will send a postcard from Google to the business address. If this

is available as a verification option, the Listings team will have already initiated it,

so there is no need for a Comms team member to do anything further.

d.  "Business video" gives the client the opportunity to show required assets to

Google in a continuous recording. This doesn't require specific coordination

from the Comms team, but you may find yourself offering support to the client

during the process so it's still good to be aware of how these verifications work.

(Business verification options do not expire and can be completed whenever is

convenient for the client.)

• Phone Number Clicks

• Email Clicks

• Newsletter Subscribe Button Clicks

• Appointments Scheduled (if they have a calender built in the site).

• Live chat initiated

Request to Cancel Yext (Listing Sync Pro) Service

We may occasionally (
) come across a request from a client or another agency,
very rarely
saying that Yext Support recommended they reach out to
marketingservices@yourdigitalagents.com to cancel their services.

This usually means that a client of ours has Listing Sync Pro (provided through Yext) activated
with one of our partners. The marketingservices@yda email was given as a means to protect
white label in these instances.

Example:

![](/img/guru/MS-Communications/93.png)

What is needed from the Marketing Services Communications team?

1. Identify the SMB and PID in question using one of the following methods.

check
 for the account in question (note: if no Marketing
VMKS/VMKW/VMKA

Services products are active, the SMB will not show up, if this happens try step

1b.)

check
 for the account in question (this is searching emails from
Vendor Center

the platform and is usually a good resource to identify the PID based on the

account name if any emails are found, if this doesn't work try 1c.)

Reach out in an #support on demand slack thread to see if they can assist us in

finding the PID. (Provide necessary details, like Company Name, Address,

Domain, etc)

2. Once you've identified the PID   notify the Main Partner Contact & the Account

Manager
that the client has reached out wanting to cancel their
in a separate thread

Listing Sync Pro service.

3. Loop in
 to the main thread if necessary as well.

Vertical | CoStar | COMMS NAP Data/Reclaim
Process

The request will come to us in a ticket and look like this:

![](/img/guru/MS-Communications/94.png)

Depending on the request you can order a listing claim or NAP.

The first thing we do is search the AGID in VMKS to see if the account has been passed back to
CoStar or not (whether or not the project is still open or not)

Also, check to ensure that work needs to be done. Sometimes we get requests to update the
hours, but when you check the listing, the hours are accurate. In this case, take a screenshot

of the listing and put it in an internal note to Elisa (Comms). This will then be communicated
with the SMS on the account.

NOTE: We do not work on Yelp or Yellow Pages anymore!

If work needs to be completed, continue:

If the project is still open:

We will do the work without charging/activating products. Check the task that is specific to the

work order (e.i. Google,
, Bing) and check on any notes.
Yelp, YellowPages

If it appears that the task being requested is already in progress, add any additional
information in the task note that may be helpful, and assign the ticket to Elisa (Comms) with
an internal note stating this.

Determining a Partner Cohort in Marketing
Services

ONLY TO BE FOLLOWED BY MANAGERS OR TEAM LEADS. MARKETING COORDINATORS ARE
NOT TO BE SELF DETERMINING COHORTS.

When a PID activates their first Marketing Services product, it's important to determine which
cohort it falls under, to determine which team needs to be assigned to their onboarding
project and to ensure all applicable processes are followed. They will also need to be added to
the appropriate cohort tab in the
Communications Lifeline

Here's how we determine a Partner's cohort:

1. Search for the PID in Partner Center:

![](/img/guru/MS-Communications/95.png)

2. Click on the account and in the bottom left, check to see who the assigned Account

Manager is.

• The PID should be assigned to the respective cohort based on their Account

Manager. (If the PID is assigned to an Agency Account Manager in Sales, it should

be assigned to Agency cohort in Marketing Services, etc.)

• Eg: Edzel (pictured below, is an Agency Account Manager, hence, this PID is with

Agency cohort)

![](/img/guru/MS-Communications/96.png)

*If the PID is unassigned (no photo/name shown), it belongs to High Velocity.

WORK ORDER

1. Close out the Work Order

2. If the Work Order needs to be closed out due to partner/client unresponsiveness, or a

request from the partner to pause the project, follow these steps:

Locate the original “Work Order Required” thread, that you previously created in

#ms support team via the automated Work Order Required slack workflow.

Add a response to that thread to provide an update, stating WHY the work is

being paused/closed out and include any applicable pertinent communication

from the partner. Be sure to specify that you're closing out the VTM project, etc.

Re tag the Vendasta Account Manager, Todd Roberts, your Team Lead or

Manager, and fulfillment manager.

Also include the next date you will be prompted to check into this (ex: 3

months during the next account check, etc.)

For products with recurring billing (Social posts 1x month, etc.) specify that

the partner will continue to be billed monthly unless this product is

canceled.

3. Locate the project in VTM. Add notes to the open tasks stating that you're closing it

out and the reason (ex: “Closing out due to unresponsiveness after 4 bouncebacks” or

“Closing out due to request from --- that was received in ticket #123456”. Mark the

tasks as completed to close out the project.

If they have asked you to pause it until a specific date, push all of the tasks due

dates to that specified date instead of closing out the project.

4. Go to the Work Orders Table and update the status to
Vendor Pause

5. Close out any applicable tickets in Zendesk. Leave an internal note linking the slack

link(s), VTM, and any applicable info regarding to why you're closing it out (ie. what

you posted in slack/VTM.)

Marketing Services X MDF Program

This information is also in Confluence for reference!

MDF programs have not been utilized by IT resellers, the programs are complicated, time 
consuming, and not well defined. Resellers do not have the marketing expertise or resources
to utilize the fund that is available. As a result, many of these funds tend to expire which does
not benefit the program or the IT provider. Marketing Services delivers a handful of services in
the package for MDF partners, including, content, websites, and digital ads. Their process is
different in the sense that the funds are heavily managed and the requirements for these
deliverables have to be met.

Important to Note: All MDF partners know we are Vendasta, so there is no risk of white label
break.

Communication Stakeholders:

@Logan Ochitwa has been the main contact for Marketing Services concerns.

Expectations for Marketing Services

![](/img/guru/MS-Communications/106.png)

Digital Ads

1st Order (Digital Ads Creatives)
Process

1. Digital Ads Creatives are usually ordered first in the program because they likely will

complete an accelerant cycle. In the future we would like to have a bank of options

for partners however, at the moment we deliver the typical digital ad set to the

partner with the typical processes.

Digital Ads Campaign (Post Creatives Deliverable & Run of Adcellerant)

Process for Quick Launch (typical second order): https://app.getguru.com/card/c9A8G7Ai

/Digital Ads Quick Launch Campaigns

1. Follow the normal process for campaigns however, when funds run out and

campaigns are canceled we notify @Logan Ochitwa rather than the partner because

he will be aware of the fund expiration/exhaustion.

Examples: coming

Websites

Process: https://app.getguru.com/card/cKkerkXi/Communications Website Onboard Checklist

The typical process for website builds is followed for the MDF projects. Occasionally, they
create the website specifically for the use of the funds and their reimbursement around MDF
requirements.

Example: coming

Social/Content

Social Posting   MDF

1. The onboarding process is similar to regular partnerships however, in the future, the

ideal scenario that we are working on is having a team member join @Logan Ochitwa

& the reseller on a call to complete the onboarding in quick sync because it is difficult

to make contact with the partner once we received a commitment from them. In this

scenario, Logan would contact us the day of or the day before to see our availability

to join the call and make sure we are included.

2. During the onboarding calls, we ask what requirements are needed to receive their

reimbursements from MDF and make sure the Social Team is aware of these

requirements.

3. Content and Strategy calls are utilized every month. Be sure to book these in advance

every month so they are completed. Meetings can be shortened if necessary. If they

also have blogs active we would ask about a topic during this call as well.

Social Posting   TD Synnex

1. The onboarding process is the typical process however, the delivery is altered to TD

Synnex portal requirements.

2. TD Synnex clients do not require account connections. They will require that

deliverables are sent to them through an excel sheet in which they can review, send

feedback, and we alter the posts. This is because the content has to be uploaded into

the website portal we host for them. *Katherine will be creating a GURU card

outlining the process for uploading to the portal.

Email Campaigns   not an actual product in the marketplace

1. These orders can come through as one time blogs that are utilized in a different

manner.

2. They are delivered on the same timeline as regular blogs (5 business days after order

is placed.

Blogs

1. This follows the typical process.

2. We send out the blog on the deadline, receive revisions, etc.

Case Studies are not an actual product in the marketplace

1. These are not typical products that all partners can order. Case Studies are utilized for

some of the IT Resellers.

2. The timeline for deliverables is once the call and content are received from the client

/partner we have 5 business days to complete the copy, then 5 business days to

complete the design aspects & deliver the piece.

3. Please note that case studies are only ordered when they are approved.

CANCELLATIONS

1. If cancelations are processed the usual reasoning for the cancelation is that the MDF

has run its course. Many of the partners/resellers are not aware of the spending

requirements or allowances so I check in with Logan to ensure the reasoning behind

the cancelation is funds related not services related.

2. There are also cancelations for the reasoning that their 'cycle' with their partnership

IE. TD Synnex or CISCO has run its course. They sign up for a certain amount of time

for trial and can extend if they wish. This can be highlighted by the partner

themselves or by Logan.

Website Vetting Incoming Order

Access the Vendor Center and review the order form. If credentials are received, select the
specified macro in Zendesk. Assign sending confirmation emails to those handling the Admin
process, and domain and back end tasks to PID assignees.

. you can filter the accounts by pause
link

date and check if any accounts are flagged for verification. If any new account is flagged

![](/img/guru/MS-Communications/118.png)

• How to communicate this to the partner?

• Go to Zendesk and Create a new ticket.

• Apply the Macro "Digital Ads   Google Verification Template"

• Search for the business in the Vendor center and copy the Business name in the

ticket. Also look for the Business location and edit the ticket respectively.

• As shown in the screenshot below, For example the business is located in US you can

delete the things needed for canada. Similarly if the business is somewhere else

Transferring calls in Sangoma

Transferring calls in Sangoma.

Always double check with the agent before transferring a call. Also, remember that the best
customer service would be to be able to help the client/partner instantly, but if the call needs
to be transferred or if the partner/client wants to speak with specific agents, below are two
ways you can transfer the call.

This can be done in two ways.

• Cold transfer

• Warm transfer

Cold Transfer:

A cold transfer in Sangoma happens when the caller is transferred directly to another party
without any prior communication between agents. You can do this by going to the "directory"
and selecting the agent. When you click on the three dots, it will give you the option of

selecting "Cold transfer".

![](/img/guru/MS-Communications/159.png)

Warm transfer:

A warm transfer in Sangoma occurs when the caller is first placed on hold while the agent
speaks to the receiving party before completing the transfer. You can do this by going to the
"directory" and selecting the agent. When you click on the three dots, it will give you the
option of selecting "Warm transfer".

Phone Etiquette

1. ANSWER RINGS IN A TIMELY FASHION. DETERMINE THE PHONE LINE & CUSTOM GREETING
BEFORE ANSWERING.

If your position entails always being available to callers, you should actually be available. That
means staying focused and answering calls immediately. The last thing you want to do is keep
a customer waiting after a string of endless ringing or send them to voicemail when you
should've been able and ready to reply.

As long as you're alert and at your phone at all times — excluding breaks — this rule should be
fairly simple to follow. If possible, we recommend responding within three rings in order give
yourself enough time to get in the zone and prepare for the call. Picking up the phone right
away might leave you flustered.

Remember: you will want to reference the
 in the lifeline to ensure you
phone queues tab
answer with the correct greeting, BEFORE you accept the call.

2. IMMEDIATELY INTRODUCE YOURSELF.

Upon picking up the phone, you should confirm with the person whom they have called. In
personal calls, it's sufficient to begin with a "Hello?" and let the caller introduce themselves

first. However, you want to allow the caller to know if they've hit a wrong number, as well as
whom they are speaking with.

Practice answer the phone with, "Hi, this is [Your first name] from [Your company]. How can I
help you?" Your customer will be met with warmth, which will encourage a positive start to

your call. And, if it ends up being an exasperated college student trying to order pizza, they'll
at least appreciate your friendliness.

3. SPEAK CLEARLY.

Phone calls, while a great option for those who detest in person interaction, do require very
strong communication skills. For one, the person on the other end of the line can only judge
you based on your voice, since they don't get to identify your body language and — hopefully
— kind smile.

You always want to speak as clearly as possible. Project your voice without shouting. You want
to be heard and avoid having to repeat yourself. A strong, confident voice can make a
customer trust you and your support more. In case of bad cell service or any inability to hear
or be heard, immediately ask to hang up and call back.

4. ONLY USE SPEAKERPHONE WHEN NECESSARY.

We all know the trials of speakerphone. It's easier for you because you can use your hands to
multitask. However, for the other caller, it's like trying to hear one voice through a honking
crowd of taxis in Manhattan — impossible and frustrating.

Give your customers your full attention, and avoid speakerphone. This will make it easier for
both parties to be heard, and it will ensure that you're actually paying attention to them. You
may need to use speakerphone at rare occasions, such as when it's a conference call or when
you're trying to troubleshoot on the phone. While speakerphone may be appropriate at these
times, it's always better to use a headset to remain hands free.

5. ACTIVELY LISTEN, AND TAKE NOTES.

Speaking of paying attention to your customers, it's essential that you're actively listening to
them throughout the conversation. Actively listening means hearing everything they have to
say and basing your response off of their comments, rather than using a prescribed script.
This proves to your customers that you're present and are empathetic to their inconveniences.

It's helpful to take notes during support calls. You'll want to file a record post conversation,
and notes will be immensely helpful. It also ensures that, during long winded explanations
from customers, you can jot down the main points and jump into problem solving without
requiring them to repeat.

6. USE PROPER LANGUAGE.

A key difference between professional and personal phone calls is obvious — the language. It
might be acceptable to use slang and swears when talking on the phone with your friends, but
this kind of language can cause you to lose a customer for life.

Always be mindful and respectful when on the phone. You never know what customers might
be offended by something you say, so it's best to use formal language. It's okay to throw in
humor if appropriate, but never crack a joke that could upset a customer.

7. REMAIN CHEERFUL.

You never know when a customer is having a bad day. When someone is rude to you on the
phone, your immediate reaction may be to put them in your place. First, though, take a
moment to step into their shoes and recognize why they're so upset.

The point is to always remain positive and friendly, especially in the face of negativity. Your
optimistic outlook may be enough to turn a failing phone call right around. Remind yourself
that the last thing your customer probably wanted was to spend their afternoon on the phone
with customer support. So, make that call the best it can be, and it may create a loyal, lifetime
customer.

8. ASK BEFORE PUTTING SOMEONE ON HOLD OR TRANSFERRING A CALL.

There's often nothing more infuriating than being put on hold. After waiting on hold for ten or
fifteen minutes to speak with a real life human being, you finally get to explain your problem.
Then, you're immediately put back on hold and then transferred to someone else to whom
you must re explain the whole problem. Talk about exhausting.

However, if you must put a customer on hold or transfer their call, always ask for their
permission first. Explain why it's necessary to do so, and reassure them that you — or another

employee — are going to get their problem solved swiftly. By keeping your customer in the
loop, they'll be less inclined to complain about a long wait time.

9. BE HONEST IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER.

You might need to put a customer on hold or transfer their call if the dreaded occurs — you
don't know the solution. Perhaps you've tried everything you can or simply have no idea what
they're talking about. Don't panic; customer support representatives are humans, too, and it's
okay not to be the omniscient voice of reason.

It's best to admit when you don't know something, rather than making excuses or giving false
solutions. However, tell them that you're going to do everything you can to find an answer and
get back to them momentarily, or find a co worker who does know the answer. Customers
don't typically expect you to have all the solutions at hand, but they will expect you to be
transparent.

10. BE MINDFUL OF YOUR VOLUME.

You may be so focused on your phone call with a customer that you're barely paying attention
to your present setting. When working in a call center, things can get pretty loud. You always
want to be mindful of your volume and ensure that you're not disrupting the ability of your co 
workers to speak to customers and get their work done.

If you are on a call that requires you to speak louder due to a bad connection or a hard of 
hearing customer, simply step out of the room and speak with them separately. Your
customers are always your main concern, but you don't want to inhibit the work ethic of
others in your workplace.

11. CHECK FOR AND RESPOND TO VOICEMAILS.

It's quite possible that a customer might reach out to you when you're on a break or after
you've left work for the day. If it's possible for you to receive voicemails, make sure you're
always checking for them. It's easy for a voicemail to slip under the radar, but the customer
won't easily forget.

Start and end each day by checking your voicemail. It takes just a few minutes and can avoid a
lost customer support request. Your customers will appreciate your prompt response, and you
can get on to doing what you do best — providing knowledgeable and friendly support.

FAQ

Why do we do cancellation calls?

We do cancellation calls to connect with our Partners about accounts that have stopped using
our services to inquire the reason for the cancellation. If the Partner asks why we do these
calls, it is so we can improve our services and offerings and for the growth and development
of our team. We love to hear feedback so we can improve on it!

Common Cancellation reasons:

• Financial problems

• Partnership expiration

• Wanted the work on themselves

• Expectation misalignment

• Timeline

• Content

• What is included

• Not benefitting the SMB

• Not using it the service

• Rebranding company

• Client stopped paying the partner

• Partner vs. client feuds

• PDM Canceled products due to insufficient funds

Always follow this process, otherwise you will change the credit card assigned to the entire
PID.

have an automated answer machine? If so, can you disable it

briefly for the next 10 minutes or less? Google will be sending a

Communications Core Services Onboard Check

List

code to your business phone number. Are you ready for me to

push that code through now?

&lt;If they can't disable answer machine and this was the only option

&gt; We will have to reach out to Google to request another

verification method, we will let you know what they are able to

offer as an alternative option. They might ask us for business

documentation, so if you would be able to send us an image or

scan of a utility bill or official document that shows your business

name and address on it then that will help speed up the process.

&lt; If email verification&gt; Google has given us the option to send a

code to the business email so I will send that through now. It may

take a minute or two, but please let me know if you see that come

in. You might have to check spam or junk folders if you do not see

it after a couple of minutes.

&lt;If SMS verification&gt; It looks like we have the option to push

through an SMS code for verification. Is the business number

connected to a cell phone that can receive texts? &lt;If yes, proceed,

if no, choose alternative method&gt;

&lt;If postcard verification has been initiated&gt; It looks like Google

has only given us the option to send a physical postcard to the

Communications Core Services Onboard Check

business address. Our team has already sent the postcard on

(check task note for date), and it should arrive within 5 to 30

business days. Please let us know when that is received at the

business and email us with the code at (comms contact email

here).

&lt;If video verification is only option&gt; INPUT STEPS TO HELP SMB

COMPLETE VIDEO VERICATION HERE   It looks like the Google

verification was successful! Our team will be going in and

ensuring that any of the information that was provided to us

beforehand including logo, cover image, additional images,

products, and services are updated on the listing! You should

already have an ownership invite that was sent to your email

(given on order form) so please check for that if you haven't

already.

f. &lt;
&gt; It looks like Google
IF LISTING IS IMMEDIATELY SUSPENDED

has suspended the listing. Sometimes they do this when manual

checks are required. Not to worry, our team will be working with

Google support directly to get the listing reinstated. We will

update you when we know more. Google will likely ask us for

business documentation, so if you would be able to send us an

image or scan of a utility bill or official document that shows your

Communications Core Services Onboard Check

List

business name and address on it then that will help speed up the

process.

2. Apple Maps Claim

&lt;IF THE BUSINESS IS A SERVICE AREA BUSINESS AND CANNOT

HAVE ITS ADDRESS SHOWN, SKIP THIS SECTION!&gt;

Next we will be working to claim and verify the Apple Maps listing

for your business. In order to start the claiming process we will

need to sign in using an Apple ID. Do you happen to have an

existing Apple ID for yourself or the business that you are

comfortable sharing the credentials for and would prefer I use? If

not I can create one for the business now and share the

credentials with you after the call.

&lt;If given existing Apple ID, proceed to Claim & Verify steps, if

creating new ID proceed to Create SMB Apple ID steps&gt;

Jump to Create SMB Apple ID

Jump to Apple Claim & Verification

3. Retroactive Review Responses

&lt;If not done already, attempt to check that there are indeed

reviews on the business's GBP that are within the last 3 months

before proceeding. If none, skip this step.&gt;

Communications Core Services Onboard Check

List

As part of this service, we will also go through and respond on

your behalf to reviews that were left within the last three months

on Google. Our team will automatically post responses to reviews

that are positive, which we count as reviews that are 4 stars or

higher.

For negative reviews, which are reviews that are 3 stars or lower, I

wanted to verify that the information we have is correct as far as

how you'd like us to deal with these reviews if we find any within

the last three months.

First I want to confirm the approval process we will be using. Is

(insert order form answer here) still the process you would like to

follow?

&lt;If they are unsure&gt; Our suggestion is to follow the 24 hour

approval process, which means we will send you our suggested

response to approve or give edits by email, but if you don't take

action on that email within 24 hours we will go ahead and post

the response.

I wanted to confirm the negative review contact which is needed

because we will be encouraging the reviewer to take the

conversation offline and contact the business directly. &lt;Confirm

IDX Integration

If you ever come across a website that has IDX integration listed and you have no idea what
that means, this is the card for you!!!!

This
 document here
 is for our Devs BUT it answers a lot of questions that we come across as
comms.

What is IDX?

The plugin pulls in the information for display on the website. That plugin connects with
the Real Estate agent's MLS provider, which is where their and other real estate agents
properties are listed in a database. Each state or province has an MLS and these plugins
link the site with the MLS.

How will I know if it is a real estate website?

Typically it will be just like a regular website, but with a couple major pages and features
added such as  

A Market (or Search) page or several depending on the demographic or market

A Featured Properties widget   typically on the homepage to highlight those properties

An IDX plugin   this is on the backend and pulls all of the information into the website for
the Real Estate Agent

What kind of things will I need to know:

The client is responsible for purchasing the subscription for the IDX plugin as well as the setup
with MLS. Once this has been completed (and usually approval is required by the client as
well), we will integrate the plugin into the website and set up the markets for display in the
widgets and pages. As a note, if the plugin is not completely finished by the client, we cannot
integrate or finish the site.

This is an add on they need to purchase through Partner Center:

Here is their pricing page for an individual agent.

Here is their pricing page for a team & brokerage.

We recommend using iHomeFinder for all your IDX needs for a wide variety of reasons. They
have great features, can cover anything from commercial to residential listings (limited to
Canada and USA), can support multiple agents and MLS listings, and can provide listing
services for a wide array of markets. They also have excellent customer support.

Not a fan of iHomeFinder? Here are other choices we'd recommend:

IDX Broker Platinum

SHOWCASE IDX

FLEX MLS

RealtyNA

What is a Market Page?

A Market Page is typically a page dedicated to searching a specific area such as a city, suburb
or even zip code. What we are able to define as markets are based on what the MLS has
defined as a market. (See the limitations questions for more information.)

What is a widget?

This is a website development term that means the box/area where a Search form or map is
shown.

What are macros?

A macro is a pre written response that can be sent to partners to make your processes go a
little faster

Things to remember:

Make sure to always personalize your Macros so they don't appear generic to partners!

Only include relevant information and delete all extra comments/notes within the macro

Some macros change the subject line of the email   always keep an eye out for that

Make sure to input all information that is missing in the [brackets]

Approving & Implementing a Spend Change
Request

**NOTE: Spend Change Requests take place at the start of the next billing cycle, they are not
instant. For an instant change a One Time Boost activation is needed.

Pending Spend Change request can be viewed in
this dashboard

1. Review the Spend Change Request to ensure their new budget will still fall within the

Digital Ads Campaign Spend minimums. This info can be found in the Digital Ads

Campaign Product Page in Partner Center.

2. If the amounts seem far fetched, always reach out to the partner to confirm. (eg:

changing from $500 to $5500, it's more likely they wanted to increase to $550 in this

instance)

if this was activated in error: decline this request.

if this was activated with errors (requested $5500 instead of $550): decline this

request and have the partner resubmit with correct info then proceed to step 3.

3. Once confirmation is received:

4. Pull up the respective account in VMKA's Task Manager and open the Project for the

specific campaign you are working on.

5. Create a new task called: Ad Campaign | Budget Edit

![](/img/guru/MS-Communications/224.png)

6. Assign this task to the Digital Ads Specialist Team Lead in charge of this PID (
Partner

) and set the
PID assignment
due date for 2 business days

7. Leave the following relevant information in the public task notes on VTM:

New monthly budget as per the Spend Change Request.

Date this change should take place (reference their billing cycle in Partner

Center).

8. Update the specialist thread in Zendesk with the information provided in step 7a and

7b and add the VTM link to the Budget Edit. Assign to the same assignee as step 6, as

with
open
,
due date for 2 business days

9. If you received a ticket for the spend change on Zendesk, copy/paste the same note

from the VTM budget and solve the ticket.

10. APPROVE THE SPEND CHANGE REQUEST

11. Update the partner with the budget and the effective date.

Marketing Services Digital Ad Campaigns vs. Take Over Campaign

(MCC Takeover)

Marketing Services Digital Ad Campaigns vs. Take
Over Campaign (MCC Takeover)

This card will highlight how a MCC Takeover campaign differs from your standard Digital Ad
Campaign:

• These campaigns are not created by the Marketing Services team, but rather, we are

granted access to a client's ad account to 'take over' their ad campaign.

• Once we receive access, our strategist will review the current campaign's performance

and will provide a preliminary recommendations and findings to the communications

team to pass along to the partner. (it is up to the partner's discretion to accept

/implement these changes)

• After this our team will continue to do monthly optimization as per the regular ad

campaign process.

• Due the ad spend, Take over campaigns qualify for monthly Strategy Calls with our

Digital Ads Strategist. These calls will be booked and hosted by the strategist.

note: Typical ad campaign communications will still live with the communications teams. ie: ad
copy changes or edits, general questions regarding the ad campaign, etc.

How to provide access to Takeover Ad Accounts

The Partner needs to provide:

Marketing Services Digital Ad Campaigns vs. Take Over Campaign

(MCC Takeover)

FOR GOOGLE ADS:

1. The account 10 digit Google ad account Customer ID

2. Access to Google Tag Manager & Google Analytics. Add "
analytics@localmarketpage.

" as an admin user.

FOR FACEBOOK ADS:

1. we will need admin access to the client's Ad account and Business Manager   (Access

can be provided by adding our business manager ID   Digital Marketing Services  

Business Manager ID: 865125153846998)

FAQs for Review Responses & Requests

1) Do I need to cancel Reputation Management Trial immediately when Review Responses
order is place?
A. No. Reputation Management just needs to be active to complete this order. Our team will
notify the partner before trial ends and they can upgrade to Reputation Management Express
/Pro later.

2) If my client switches from customer voice pro to express, will they lose all of the clients they
currently have listed in their account.
A. No. However, with downgrade to Customer Voice Express they will lose features like bulk
review requests, automated follow up email, SMS add ons, and mobile kiosk.

3) Why do I need to purchase Reputation Management Pro and not Reputation Management
Express?
A. Reputation Management Express is sufficient for Google/Facebook reviews, but for
additional platforms like Yelp, Pro is required.

4) My client has a duplicate listing, and customers are leaving reviews on it. Will this affect
their reviews on the correct listing?
A. No. However, it is advisable to have the duplicate listing closed by contacting the platform
(Google, Yelp, etc.)

5) Do you respond to all negative reviews or only negative reviews with comments?
A. We respond to all negative reviews with or without comments.

6) My client has possible fake reviews, can you remove them?
A. We can report these reviews to the platform (Google/Facebook/Yelp) and if they violate their
policy they can delete them. However, we cannot guarantee their removal.

7) I want review requests sent out frequently, can you do it weekly?
A. Yes, we can customize as per business requirements. (Our usual option is monthly/bi 
monthly/quarterly)

8) Can you edit the bottom part of review request template?
A. No.

![](/img/guru/MS-Communications/225.png)

9) My client is a health practitioner and your review request customer list has first and last
name sections, will the patient details be revealed online?

 We follow a strict
 while responding to medical business
 Never.
HIPAA compliance process
reviews. Also, we just use email address to send review requests and the SMB can choose not
to send the first and last names inform.

10) I have negative review from my past employee, can you deal with it?

A. We usually do not respond to past employee reviews, we recommend you reaching out to
them directly. However, we can report it if you insist.

11) Is it possible to send review request to people who did not participate?

A. Yes, we can filter the list and resend emails. (Super Task Bros fulfills this request under
Listings Management)

12) Is there a specific time of day when review requests are successful? Can you track the
performance?

A. We can track the performance in Customer Voice, however, we cannot pinpoint specific time
slot like mornings or afternoons.

13) Can I send a customer list more than once in a month?

A. Yes, you can send us lists anytime. However, review requests will be only send out once a
week to customers.

14) Can my client change the review sites the positive reviews are posted to?

Yes. In fact we encourage it to get the most out of this service. (You can also suggest this
during C&S calls)

15) Can you pause the Reputation Management service? My client has not paid yet.

A. No. We cannot pause the service on your behalf. You will need to cancel it on your part to
avoid getting billed monthly.

Leave a note in the Partner's SSC. Include all necessary information

WORK ORDER

1. Close out the Work Order

2. If the Work Order needs to be closed out due to partner/client unresponsiveness, or a

request from the partner to pause the project, follow these steps:

Locate the original “Work Order Required” thread, that you previously created in

#ms support team via the automated Work Order Required slack workflow.

Add a response to that thread to provide an update, stating WHY the work is

being paused/closed out and include any applicable pertinent communication

from the partner. Be sure to specify that you're closing out the VTM project, etc.

Re tag the Vendasta Account Manager, Todd Roberts, your Team Lead or

Manager, and fulfillment manager.

Also include the next date you will be prompted to check into this (ex: 3

months during the next account check, etc.)

For products with recurring billing (Social posts 1x month, etc.) specify that

the partner will continue to be billed monthly unless this product is

canceled.

3. Locate the project in VTM. Add notes to the open tasks stating that you're closing it

out and the reason (ex: “Closing out due to unresponsiveness after 4 bouncebacks” or

“Closing out due to request from --- that was received in ticket #123456”. Mark the

tasks as completed to close out the project.

If they have asked you to pause it until a specific date, push all of the tasks due

dates to that specified date instead of closing out the project.

4. Go to the Work Orders Table and update the status to
Vendor Pause

5. Close out any applicable tickets in Zendesk. Leave an internal note linking the slack

link(s), VTM, and any applicable info regarding to why you're closing it out (ie. what

you posted in slack/VTM.)

New accounts are Paused in Task Manager (VTM)

If you don't want those new accounts to all start off as paused...

In VTM, go into the PID and then Settings &gt;&gt; Account settings, and toggle the setting to "start
accounts in active state'.It won't affect any already active accounts, just new ones that come in.
But it may help for some of those pesky accounts that you experience this often with!

When to use a VTM comment or task note?

When an update is related directly to a VTM task in a project, please leave the update in
the task note.

Website task updates should always be left in the

When an update isn't directly related to a specific task, and is related to the project as a

What features are visible in VTM to partners
/clients?

In VTM, you may have noticed that some things are mentioned as being "visible in business
app" or "not visible in business app." You may have also wondered what "public" and "private"
means, and who is able to view it.

For VMKW/VMKS/VMKA projects, here is what
 can see via their PID
partners
in VTM:

Public Task Notes: Yes

Private Task Notes: Yes

Public Comments: Yes

Private Comments: Yes

Account Notes: Yes

Assignees: No

For VMKW/VMKS/VMKA projects, here is what
 can see via Business

Private Task Notes: No

As a best practice, always use white label practices when leaving public/private notes,
comments, etc.

Ex: Referring to the partner as Jim instead of "partner"

But at least now you should have a better idea of what's actually being seen by partners and
clients! :)

How do we resend a CSAT survey?

We have a macro—MS: Negative CSAT Followup
The macro leaves an internal note and adds a tag that will push the survey through the next
automation cycle (once the ticket is solved again.)

You can use this when someone has submitted a negative CSAT score and you have worked to
resolve their remaining issues and they would like to refill out the survey.

If they fill out the new CSAT, the new score will replace the old score. If they do not, the
original score will remain.

Social Marketing | Expired LinkedIn Connection
Process

Since LinkedIn requires users to reconnect their account in Social Marketing Pro every few
weeks, the social team will often reach out on VTM by tagging the respective Comms person
assigned to the account to reach out to the client or partner in order to get them to reconnect
the account.

Negative CSAT Received Process

Managers should be monitoring the CSAT dashboard in Zendesk Explore daily.

When a negative CSAT is received:

1. Manager flags ticket with assigned team member and investigates.

Was a comment left?

If not, check into the ticket Events:

![](/img/guru/MS-Communications/248.png)

Check when the CSAT was offered/given. If the score was changed
multiple times, that means it was a false score (caused by email spam
security testing out the links.)
Example of false CSAT: (click + to expand image)

![](/img/guru/MS-Communications/249.png)

Old CSATs may show under the current month if the ticket reopens
and is solved again. Previous month's CSATs don't need to be re 
followed up on/counted for the current month's true CSAT score.
Once established that it appears to be a recent and valid CSAT score, the

remove any additional CC'd contacts on the ticket, as they would not have received
the survey, and may get confused on your next email.)

If the requester left a comment where they complained about their interaction with
the coordinator, then the manager should reach out instead.

Responses should be personalized to ensure authenticity, but here is an example:

"Hi --- ,

I hope this email finds you well! My manager flagged that you had a negative
experience based on the response from the last Customer Satisfaction Survey. We're
so sorry to hear that we didn't meet the mark for you! Please let us know what we can
do to rectify this for you, as we want to ensure you are satisfied.

Looking forward to your reply!"

response is given, the ticket will reopen on the selected date as a reminder to follow 
up.
Be sure to note any additional steps taken (in an internal note.) If they give feedback
and it's resolved, we can send a follow up message thanking them and letting them
know they may receive a follow up survey and to feel free to fill it out.

4. a.

After sending that public response, go back in the ticket and apply the MS:

macro, which will send a second survey.
Negative CSAT Follow Up (re Survey)
If they give a new rating, it'll override the original one.

If the requester responds to our follow up with "Oh I don't remember filling a CSAT
survey" or something, it could be a false CSAT result.

In that case, respond and say that you've noted it as a false response and thank
them for their time. Then add this to an internal note so when we reference this
ticket in the future, we can see the update and discount this CSAT score.

If calling feels more natural, we encourage that too! Do whichever feels most
comfortable. If calling, record the updates in an internal note in the ticket.

Zendesk | Creating & Adding PID/Organization to
Your Ticket

Organizations in Zendesk are essentially groups that you can add end users to (end users =
external contacts with emails that aren't Zendesk agents.)

Linking organizations to users in Zendesk helps us easily identify what PID a user is associated
with (partner, client, Vendasta employee, etc.)

Linking an Organization to an End User:

When a user is not linked to an organization, you can see this in the top left of a ticket. It will
either say "No organization" or it will have an automated suggestion with "(create)" next to it:

![](/img/guru/MS-Communications/253.png)

![](/img/guru/MS-Communications/254.png)

Follow these steps to add link an organization to an end user if they aren't
yet linked:

1. Click on the end user's name displayed in the middle:

![](/img/guru/MS-Communications/255.png)

2. Click "
Add Organization

![](/img/guru/MS-Communications/256.png)

3. Type in the PID or the agency name. (If one doesn't work, try the other.)

Select the correct PID/agency from the drop down selection. If none appear, this

means that your desired organization hasn't been created yet.

If that's the case, follow the tutorial lower in this Guru card to create a

new

organization.

4. Once you have
, this will auto save to this end user's contact
selected the organization

info. You can navigate back to your ticket by clicking on the ticket number on the top

left.

If there is no organization from the drop down, you should create a new
one:

1. Click on the tab on the far left with "(create)" next to it:

![](/img/guru/MS-Communications/257.png)

2. Adjust the fields in this panel.

Organization name should follow this format: Partner Agency Name (PID)

ex: Rockstar Marketing (GHOO)

Remove the email domain UNLESS it is the user's custom domain.

Domains listed here will let any future email contacts with those domains in their

email get automatically added to this organization.

So don't do it for anyone with "gmail.com" etc. emails, but you can do it for

custom domains that only they would use (ie. rockstarmarketing.com etc.)

3. Click on the organization name. You will be taken to the panel where you can edit

further details for this organization.

4. Add the PID as a tag (lowercase) and in the PID field (uppercase)

![](/img/guru/MS-Communications/258.png)

5. These changes will autosave. You can navigate back to your ticket by clicking the

ticket number at the top.

# Google Business Profile Verification Documents

Google's main goal is to confirm three things: Location, Existence/Equipment, and Proof of Management.

**Required Documents/Proof (USA & Canada - General)**

These documents should clearly show your Business Name and Address listed on your Google Business Profile.

**Proof of Address** — Confirms your business operates at the listed address.
* Utility Bill (Gas, Water, Electric, Internet, Landline phone) from the last 3-6 months
* Lease Agreement or Property Tax Bill.
* Business Insurance Documents.

**Proof of Legal Existence** — Confirms the business is an official entity.
* USA: Business License, Formation documents (e.g., Articles of Incorporation, LLC docs), Secretary of State documentation, EIN document.
* Canada: Business License, Registration/Incorporation documents (e.g., from provincial/territorial government or Corporations Canada).

**Proof of Management** — Confirms the person verifying is authorized.
* Government-issued Photo ID of the owner/manager (must match the person in a video if using that method).
* Non-sensitive business documents like Invoices (showing business name/address), Business Bank Statements, or Payroll records.

**Special Requirements for Service Area Businesses (SAB)**

A Service Area Business (SAB) is one that visits or delivers to customers (e.g., plumbers, cleaners) and should not display a public storefront address on their GBP unless they staff the location during business hours.

Since there is no customer-facing storefront, the verification often relies heavily on Video Verification. The video must prove:

| Verification Component | What to Show in the Video | Supporting Documents to Have Ready |
|------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Location | Show the home base address (even if hidden from the public profile) and nearby street signs or landmarks. | Utility Bill or Lease for the home base address (must match GBP internal address). |
| Business Existence | Show branded materials, tools, or equipment. | Business License, Registration, or Insurance Certificate (all showing business name and home base address). |
| Proof of Management | Show a Branded Vehicle (with clear business name) being unlocked/started, or show your workspace/home office with industry-specific equipment. | Invoices, Business Cards, or Marketing Materials with the business name. |

💡 **SAB Pro Tip:** Do not use P.O. Boxes, virtual offices, or co-working spaces as your base address, as Google strictly prohibits these unless they are staffed during business hours.

**Recommended Best Practices (USA & Canada)**

• **Consistency is Key:** Ensure the Business Name, Address, and Phone Number are exactly the same across all documents, your website, and the GBP profile.

• **Video Preparation:** If using video verification (the most common method):
  • Record in one continuous, unedited shot.
  • Do not show faces or sensitive data (like bank account numbers or SSN/SIN).
  • Ensure good lighting and audio.

• **Digital Copies:** Have clear, high-resolution digital copies (PDF or JPG) of all key documents ready to upload in case Google requests a manual review.

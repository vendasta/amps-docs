## When to offer a call?
1. When dealing with matters specific to a customer's account, such as two_factor

authentication or verification codes received via phone or text message.

2. If a Partner issue requires immediate attention or has been escalated to a higher level

of support, offering a call can expedite the resolution process and demonstrate a

higher level of care and urgency.

3. If there have been multiple back_and_forths (at least two responses), it is

recommended to set up a phone call. Reach out to the communications team,

determine a suitable time slot, and offer a call.

4. If a partner requests a phone call, it is advisable to arrange one after discussing with

the respective teams and determining a convenient time slot.

Please coordinate with the specific PID owner for outbound calls to ensure their availability and tag them accordingly in GCHAT.

Note to remember
We don't offer a call by default.

## Steps when you receive a Website Copy order ticket

Note: Overall goal when receiving these tickets, is to get the partner/client to book the content
call. Then to help pass the notes from the meeting to the writers so they can write up the new
copy and implement it onto the website.

1. Once you receive the order ticket. Check to see when the order confirmation was sent

![](/img/guru/Legacy-Cards-not-on-a-Board/10.png)

2. If the order confirmation was sent on the day you received it, wait a day to send a
follow up about booking the consultation call.
Once you confirmed the partner/client booked the content call. Set the ticket pending
until the day of when the call will be completed.
Notes will then be provided from the call and put into the slack project thread

![](/img/guru/Legacy-Cards-not-on-a-Board/11.png)

6. The writers will then start creating the new web copy from the notes made on the call
Once the Web copy has been completed the team working on this website project will
be notified in the project thread on slack. They will implement the newly written copy
on the website. (
the team requests a website support request task to be created in
If
VTM. Create a website support request Tier 2)
Once the web copy has been implemented onto the website. The team will let you
know to send the updated link to the partner. Send the response to the partner

## FAQs Listing: How FCL and the local Co_op work together on Google My Business?

FCL generally directs local co_ops to our team when it comes to issues related to Google My
Business like claiming property or postcards or other Google claim issues. Co_op team doesn't
have access directly to the Google My Business property when the sync is set up so we often
cannot see why something may be failing. The only information that we can provide to the
local co_op's with respect to Google My Business, is to ensure that the CPA location does not
have multiple sets of hours or multiple locations with the same phone number and address, as
in the past Google has rejected sync updates due to those reasons.

As far as the connection between the local co_op, FCL, and Google My Business, The link here
is an article on an internal site that the local co_op can access. This article will hopefully help
explain some of the connections the CPA has
https://www.hub.crs/myportal/home/content
/2535e95b_ffdc_4760_9166_49acaf78bd68
.

Local Co_op's utilize what is known as the Co_op Profile Application accessible through our
internal website known as the Hub to manage the client's location information and
information about their local co_op like contacts and board of directors. This information is
sent to a number of our own websites but additionally, if they have opted in, is also sent
through an API to our system which creates an account in Partner Centre for our team to
claim and help manage the connection point to Google My Business and whatever other
systems are included in our package.

What if local co_op's wish to manage Google My Business solely on their own without the
assistance of our data sync?

If they choose to do so, we can turn off sending data to your system from our CPA, however,
we cannot do this at a per_property level, so if you only wanted to manage Google My
Business but not the other properties, you would lose access to data updating on those other
properties, not just Google.

FCL also provides standard naming conventions for the local co_op's to utilize while on Google
My Business so that brand consistency is seen across the Co_operative Retailing System (CRS).
This includes having the listing name as Co_op Liquor instead of for example Southland Co_op
Liquor.

## What To Do When a Partner Isn't Receiving Email Through Zendesk

Are you sending emails to your partner that aren't being received? It could be because the
partner's email provider is quarantining the emails sent from Zendesk. If the partner is using
Outlook, here are the steps to follow to address the issue.

3. Confirm with the partner that they are not receiving the emails.
Speak to your direct manager to bring the issue to the forefront.
Reach out to Support on Demand to ensure that everything looks good on our end,
and to get records to add to the partner's DNS settings.
Get the partner (or their IT team) to add the records to their DNS settings for Zendesk.
Old threads will likely be unable to be sent from, so new threads will need to be
created. Once the new thread is created, merge the old thread into the new one to
ensure no breaks in communication

## Transferring a domain from our account to a client/partner's account

When we purchase a domain on a client or partner's behalf, they are able to keep the domain
if they transfer web hosting from us or if they build a new website outside of Vendasta
Marketing Services.

For domains that we have purchased on behalf of a client or partner, we can transfer the
domain to their Google Domains or GoDaddy account. If they do not have an account with one
of these Domain Registrars, they should create one and let us know what email address their
account is associated to.

Once we know the email address and domain registrar we are transferring a domain to, we
can submit a Website Support Request and the team will unlock the domain and send the
authorization code to the client. The authorization code will be sent to your administrative
email.

The client will use the authorization code (sometimes called "EPP codes" or "Transfer codes")
in order to get access to the domain on their account with their domain registrar. The
placement of the authorization code differs based on the target domain registrar

Adding GTM/GA codes to Divi websites:

Adding a Google Tag Manager to a Divi website is not something difficult, but it is something
that our partners appreciate having us do when possible. Rather than having to reach out to
the partner and have them request the addition of the GTM, or having them add it themselves,
we are able to let them know that the GTM has already been proactively added. The steps are
included below.

1. The first and most important step is finding the GTM code. This code is likely linked or

attached to the specialist thread, but if it is not you should be able to find the drive

link in the accounts Task Notes.

    a. The GTM itself will be quite small (e.g., 'GTM_W7LGXQZ'), but the entire code will

be several lines of text

2. Once you've found the code, ensure that it is not already included on the site. You can

do this by using the chrome extension 'Google Tag Assistant Legacy'. Use this chrome

extension to take a look at the GTM and GA codes already present on the site.

3. As long as the GTM code is not already present on the site, we can now add the GTM

code!

4. The location in the Divi dashboard that we are looking for is called Divi Integrations

    a. From the WordPress Dashboard, along the left there should be a tab called 'Divi',

click on this one

    b. From there, a menu of subcategories will be present, select 'Theme Options'

    c. In 'Divi Theme Options', select the 'Integration' tab

    d. In the Integrations tab, you are now looking for two boxes in which code can be

included, one for the &lt;head&gt; and one for the &lt;body&gt;:

    e. These boxes correspond directly to the code included in the GTM doc for a given

account. One code is for the header, the other for the body

![](/img/guru/Legacy-Cards-not-on-a-Board/45.png)

    f. Paste the code for the &lt;head&gt; in the relevant section and the code for &lt;body&gt;

into the relevant section and then click the save button. Your screen should look

something like the screenshot below. (
 Where the code is placed in the
Note:

relevant section is not very important. As long as it is in there and is not in the

middle of another snippet of code there shouldn't be a problem.)

5. Once this has been completed, reload the page (on another browser) and double_

check Google Tag Assistant Legacy to ensure that the GTM code has been added. If

you do not see it, reach out to a team member or a member of the Website Support

team as they will be able to help you troubleshoot!

    a. This is something like what Google Tag Assistant Legacy should look like with the

proper GTM code

## GETTING TO KNOW THE PIDS FOR LISTING CLAIMS
A Marketing Services POV

• PPOP _ They have a specific macro to use when sending out confirmation email.

_Marco: PPOP _ Successfully claimed

_Branded Email:
PatientPop@yourdigitalagents.com

Then solve ticket.

FYI: PatientPop_ PPOP has merged with another organization to form Tebra. So you may see
some orders come from a patient pop email and some come from a Tebra, then eventually all
should be Tebra

• 0MET _ Most of their listing tickets are just follow up so always check VTM as listings
team doesnt leave internal notes on ZD, they prefer putting updates on VTM.

Branded email to uses: listings@yourdigitalagents.com

For 0MET, we use this email:
to send invite abnd
digitalagents@marketmybusinesstoday.com

0MET usually provides us access to the listing as soon as they submit a ticket.

_If in VTM notes, its stated:
Use this
Need info from partner before we claim Please reach out.
Macro:

We received an order for [business name) but haven't yet received any information regarding
the claim from your team, can you let us know if there's anything in particular we need to
know before we proceed with this claim?

Sent out: kayanna@marketmybusinesstoday.com

CC: paige@marketmybusinesstoday.com, abraham@marketmybusinesstoday.com,
mackenzie@marketmybusinesstoday.com

If in cases where we completed all necessary work on our end and then changes were made to

the listing by the client and/or the partner which triggered reverification after passing the
listing off to them. We SHOULDN'T move forward in hepling them with reverification especially
when they order the basic reverification with us and use this macro to sent to partner/client:

"We understand that the listing requires reverification; however, we completed our initial
claim back on [date] and the product ordered only includes one claim without ongoing
support. If you'd like us to work to reverify/unsuspend this listing, you'll need to re_order the
claim product."

Confirmation Email:

I am pleased to inform you that we have created a new listing for (business name and
location) and have verified it as well.

The ++Market My Business Today location group has been added onto the listing. Please let
me know if any other users are needing to be added.

Then solve.

• HS6R_ Sending off confirmation email for this PID also had a special process.

Macro: HS6R _ Google Listings Updates

Branded Email: marketingservices@yourdigitalagents.com

Replace the title HS6R with the business name and location then solve ticket.

![](/img/guru/Legacy-Cards-not-on-a-Board/48.png)

For insight on HS6R, the location eligibility/suspension rate was a bit higher than usual when
we started to work on the HS6R.Which made Sam reduce the number of daily orders to
around 9~10. We saw success for a few months, but a mass suspension started happening on
listings created 2 to 3 months back. That's when Sam pointed out Google had changed its
policies which triggered the old listings to get suspended.

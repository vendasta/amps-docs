# How is the GMB Review Rating Calculated 

The review rating is based on the average of all the reviews.

Looking into 
, as an example
Summit Augusta

the breakdown is as follows:

* 29 Five Star Reviews (29 x 5 = 145)

* 2 Four Star Reviews (2 x 4 = 8)

* 2 Three Star Reviews (2 x 3 = 6)

* 1 Two Star Review (1 x 2 = 2)

* 8 One Star Reviews (8 x 1 = 8)

If you add up the totals (145+8+6+2+8) you get 169. Then divide by the total number of reviews (42), 
you get 4.02, which gets rounded down to 4 which is the current overall review rating for the listing.

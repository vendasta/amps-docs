1) If a quote request comes through this form: http://pre sale website request.marketingservices.dev/

The submitter receives an email specifying the turnaround time of 3 business days.

The website team will own that ticket and send the quote directly once completed

2) If the quote request comes from any other channel, like GCHAT (from sales or a leader) or via
Zendesk ticket with a partner,

days.

They will share the quote on the same ticket and reassign it to you.

Share the quote with the partner and solve both of those tickets.

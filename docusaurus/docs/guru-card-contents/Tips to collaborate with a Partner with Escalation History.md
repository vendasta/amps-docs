# Tips to collaborate with a Partner with Escalation History

We all have been there where we have been handed over a partner/client with a history of escalation. 
We naturally are extra careful with those partners. Here are some additional tips that can help us work 
with these partners with more confidence.

  Escalation History:

* A very good understanding of the reason for escalation is very important. It's the key to improving

the relationship with the partner.

* Keeping a note of trigger words and actions for that partner.

* If the partner is being handed over, it's very important to transfer these notes as well.

  Establish Clear Communication platform:

* Open and transparent communication is paramount. Depending on which cohort you are working

in, it's very important for the partner to know our communication process. If you're a new

communications team member taking over, make sure to send an introductory email or set up a

call to set the communication expectations.

  Set Mutual Expectations:

* Clearly define roles, responsibilities, and expectations from the outset. Ensure alignment on goals

and outcomes to prevent misunderstandings.

  Address Past Escalations Proactively:

* Acknowledge previous escalations without dwelling on them. Use them as learning opportunities

to prevent similar issues in the future.

  Foster Positive Relationships:

* Focus on building trust and rapport with the partner. Invest time in developing a constructive

working relationship based on mutual respect.

  Practice Active Listening:

* Listen attentively to the partner's concerns and feedback. Demonstrate empathy and

understanding to foster a supportive working environment.

  Collaborate on Solutions:

* Approach challenges collaboratively and seek input from both parties when resolving issues.

Encourage brainstorming and idea sharing to find mutually beneficial solutions.

  Document Agreements and Decisions:

* Maintain clear records of agreements, decisions, and action items. This helps prevent

misunderstandings and provides a reference point for future discussions. Make sure to record

meetings for future reference.

  Focus on Continuous Improvement:

* Emphasize a commitment to ongoing improvement and learning from past experiences.

Encourage feedback loops to identify areas for enhancement.

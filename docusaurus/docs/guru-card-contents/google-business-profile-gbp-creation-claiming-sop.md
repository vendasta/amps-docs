## GOOGLE BUSINESS PROFILE (GBP) CREATION & CLAIMING: STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
(SOP)

  Purpose

This document outlines the mandatory process for creating and claiming Google Business Profile
(GBP) listings. This new procedure is designed to resolve the "limit issues" and spam flags that occur
when team members use individual email accounts to manage listings.

All claiming and creation must now be done through the central Organization account.

  The Core Principle: Working from the Organization Account

The primary reason for previous "limit issues" is Google flagging individual email accounts as spam.
The new process solves this by routing all activity through our verified Organization account.

* You MUST log in to
 with your own personal email.
business.google.com

* You MUST select the correct Organization from the top left corner
 taking any action.
before

* You MUST use the 10 digit Group ID (not an email) when requesting access to an existing profile.

* You must NEVER attempt to claim a listing from the Google Search results page (e.g., clicking

"Own this business?") . This will flag your account as spam.

  Initial Setup (For New Team Members)

Before you can work on listings, you must be added to the Organization.

Accept Invitations: Your manager will invite your email to two groups:

"Boca Broadley Listings"

(for direct customers) and
 (for Vendasta/channel customers) . You
"Digital Marketing Services"

must accept both invitations in your email.

Prerequisite Check: If your individual email account already owns any GBP listings, you cannot

be added to the Organization. You must first transfer ownership of those listings to the main

group and remove yourself as a user .

Wait for Integration: After accepting, log in to
. It may take
business.google.com
1 2 hours or

for the Organization names to appear in the top left corner dropdown. You cannot
overnight

proceed until you see these options.

  Workflow 1: How to Create a Brand New Listing

Use this process when a business does
 have an existing GBP.
not

Log in to
.
business.google.com

Select the correct
 from the top left dropdown (e.g., "Broadly" for direct,
Organization

"Marketing Services" for Vendasta).

Select the corresponding
 (e.g., "Boca Broadley Listings" or "Digital Marketing
Profile Group

Services") .

Click the blue
 button and select
.
"Add Business"
"Add a single business"

Follow the on screen prompts, searching for the business name
.
within this workflow

The system will either confirm the business is new or find an existing profile .

Complete the creation steps. This method will automatically verify the listing if possible, or

place it into the standard verification flow.

  Workflow 2 (Revised): How to Request Access to an Existing Listing

Stop
: DO NOT ask the client to add an email address.

Find the Group ID:
 for the correct brand ("Boca Broadly
Get the 10 digit Business Group ID

Listings" or "Digital Marketing Services").

Instruct the Client (The Key Step): This is the safest way to gain access without creating

duplicates.

* Ask the client to log in to their Google Account associated with their business.

* If they don't know which account, have them try their primary business emails.

* If they want us to do it on their behalf,
request the access from the correct brand group

Boca Broadly Listings or Digital Marketing Services

* Once they are in their GBP, instruct them to: a. Go to "
" &gt; "
Business Profile settings
People

". b. Click "
". c. Paste the
 into the email field . d. Set the
and access
Add
10 digit Group ID

access level to "
" or "
" and click "
".
Manager
Owner
Invite

  Accept the Invitation: Accept the invitation from your main Organization dashboard.

What if the client can't find their profile or has lost access?

 Do not create a duplicate
.

* The client must go through Google's "Request ownership" flow themselves first. They will request

access from the current (unknown) owner.

* If the current owner doesn't respond after 3 days, the client may be given the option to claim and

re verify the profile themselves.

* Only after the client has regained access should they invite your Group ID.

This "client first" approach keeps your agency compliant. Your role is as an authorized representative,
and this workflow respects the business owner's primary ownership, which is a key part of Google's

third party policy.

By removing the step to "create a duplicate listing," your SOP becomes much more resilient against
Google's spam filters and significantly reduces the risk of your teams being flagged again.

## METHOD 2 (ALTERNATE): AGENCY REQUESTS FROM CLIENT

Use this if the client cannot follow Method 1 or if you are not concerned with white labeling (i.e., for

direct Broadly clients).

Log in to
 and select your
 and
 as described in
business.google.com
Organization
Profile Group

Workflow A.

Click
 &gt;
.
"Add business"
"Add a single business"

Search & Find: Type the client's business name. The system will find the existing profile and

state that it is "owned by someone else" .

Request Access: The system will present a
 form.
"Request access to manage this business"

Fill Form Correctly: Fill out the form with the
:
o?cial agency contact information

 For Broadly (Direct) Clients:

* What level of access:

Ownership (By requesting management access, and if the

current (unknown) owner doesn't respond or rejects our request, we will most of the

time not get a chance to appeal and claim the listing away. Then we were basically

stuck unless we requested ownership access through a different email because you

cannot use the same email again.

* Your contact name: [Your Name]

* Your phone number:
+1 800 266 0219

* Your agency name:
Broadly

* Agency email address:
listings@broadly.com

 For Vendasta (Channel) Clients:

* What level of access: Ownership

* Your contact name: [Your Name]

* Your phone number:
+1 866 378 8031

* Your agency name:
 (or other approved white label name)
Your Digital Agents

* Agency email address:
admin@yourdigitalagents.com

Submit & Wait: Click "Submit." The client (the profile owner) will receive an email to approve

your request.

## REFERENCE: 10 DIGIT GROUP IDS

When requesting access (Workflow 2), use the following static 10 digit ID. This ID  the group name
is
and never changes.

* For Direct (Broadly) Customers:

* Group Name: Boca Broadley Listings

* 10 Digit ID: 5284977751

* For Channel (Vendasta) Customers:

* Group Name: Digital Marketing Services

* 10 Digit ID: 5265223252

Bing:

As for Bing, the process is very similar to Google:

  Check for an existing listing

  Log in to our Bing Dashboard (bingplaces@yourdigitalagents.com)

3  Once logged in, in the top right corner, click the 3 little dots and then "Add a business". A menu will
pop up where you will select "Claim or add manually".

4  Search the business name and city/state. If a listing with matching info appears, click the listing and
then "claim listing". If no listing appears/exists, at the bottom of the page, click "Create a new listing".

  Follow the prompts depending on which path you take.

* If Claiming Existing: Note down the verification methods being offered in the task notes and

assign them to the comms team member.

* If building a new listing, enter the business info as requested, note down the verification methods,

and assign it to the comms team.

6  Work to verify the listing with the partner/client, and once verified comms team will assign the task
back to us or mark it as complete.

## POTENTIAL RISKS & CONSIDERATIONS (COMPARED TO GOOGLE)

Your process is sound, but it's important to note that Bing's system is generally
 and
less complex
less
 than Google's regarding agency management.
strict

* No "Organization" Structure: Bing does not have a formal "Organization account" or "Profile Group

ID" system like Google's. Your method of using a single, dedicated agency email (
)
bingplaces@...

is the correct equivalent.

* No "Claiming from Search" Penalty: Unlike Google, Bing does not appear to penalize users for

initiating a claim from the Maps interface. However, your SOP of
 starting from the
always

dashboard is a safer and more scalable best practice.

* Google Import: The fastest and often preferred method for claiming a Bing listing is to import it

.
directly from your Google Business Profile

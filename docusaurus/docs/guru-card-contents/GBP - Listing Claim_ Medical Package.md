You might be asking, is there a different medical package for a whole practice or is this meant strictly 
for each practitioner at the location? Does this product cover the entire practice?

Answer: The medical package is intended for individual practitioners. However, once verified and 
claimed, we do include their practice location in the listing.

So, if you see an order for medical practice or organization get a confirmation first to avoid product 
cancellation and refunds at a later stage.

Additional Info:

We claim and verify their listings on any three platforms with Listing Claim: Medical Package.

RateMDs

Web MD/Vitals (Only Updates and both are considered as separate claims but their support

team is same)

Healthgrades

Doctors.com
.

Important Point:

If any doctor's listing is sponsored a third party (former employer, other listing services provider, an 
individual, etc.) and they want to cancel it, they will need to reach out and resolve the issue. We can 
fulfill once the sponsorship issue is resolved.

Partners on Starter, Startup, or Individual who ask to cancel may reach out to our Support Team to 
do so (

).

Scenario (A): A High Velocity Partner assigned to "Customer Success"asks to 
cancel or downgrade their contracted subscription.

If a Partner within the High Velocity cohort makes a request to downgrade or cancel their

contracted subscription to a Marketing Services Agent, whether by email, call, meeting, or

chat, the Marketing Services agent will create a post in the partner relations GChat channel

using the following posting template:

PID:

TL;DR: Summary of Partner's Request, include any context you have/can provide (any MS concerns or 
friction, if applicable), if the concern is related to specific client account(s) please include the AGID(s).

Opp: not created (will be created by retention case owner)

CC: tag Lily Yip, Brady Lang, Amanda Boruch, Craig Taylor, Rashida Bencherif

Once the post is created by the MS agent, the CSM agent, or Rashida  whoever will be owning

the retention case   will comment so in the PR Post's thread, create the Retention Opportunity,

and reach out to the Partner.

If the Partner's concerns stem from an MS Project, a call with the Partner, appropriate MS team member and/or MS Leadership to review and discuss will likely be needed as part of the retention/saves motion.

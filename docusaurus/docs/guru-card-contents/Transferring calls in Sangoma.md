# Transferring calls in Sangoma

Always double check with the agent before transferring a call. Also, remember that the best customer 
service would be to be able to help the client/partner instantly, but if the call needs to be transferred 
or if the partner/client wants to speak with specific agents, below are two ways you can transfer the 
call.

This can be done in two ways.

* Cold transfer

* Warm transfer

Cold Transfer:

A cold transfer in Sangoma happens when the caller is transferred directly to another party without 
any prior communication between agents. You can do this by going to the "directory" and selecting 
the agent. When you click on the three dots, it will give you the option of selecting "Cold transfer".

Warm transfer:

A warm transfer in Sangoma occurs when the caller is first placed on hold while the agent speaks to 
the receiving party before completing the transfer. You can do this by going to the "directory" and 
selecting the agent. When you click on the three dots, it will give you the option of selecting "Warm 
transfer".

# Google Business Profile Ownership Access

So if we are creating a Google Business Profile for the customer. We will be the Primary Owner of it 
since we create it.
So after creating it we always need to give the Ownership access to the customer in the first or after it 
gets verified.
It is our choice but in the end the Client should get the Owner access.

Only then he will be able to do all the edits and other stuffs with the Profile which we created for him.

Step 1: Click on the 3 dots which is showing in between the Page.

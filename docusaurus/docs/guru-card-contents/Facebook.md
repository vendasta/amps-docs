## New Facebook Updates on Connection
Previously You will be able to connect the Facebook and Instagram together if you have Full
access to that Facebook Page.

But now whoever creates the Facebook Page that Primary Owner of that Page will only be able
to connect the Facebook and Instagram.

If you only have Full access to that page you will not be able to connect it to Instagram even
though you have Instagram credentials with you. It will be greyed and you cannot click on that
button. It will show additional access to connect this Page to Instagram (that means you

should be the Creator/Primary Owner of that Page)

## Facebook Account (How to give Facebook Primary Ownership Access)

If you don't have a main access to that profile you will not be able to do few things in Facebook
Page even though you have full access to that page.

So if you need to get that access where the creator has you need to ask them to add your
personal Facebook address and give an invitation to our personal account

So once you accept it from your Personal FB page you will be able to get access that full
creator access and you can add/delete people and connect IG and you will have full control
over it.

# Social Posts  1x Week Incoming Order

Assign the admin tasks to yourself, i.e., admin work. Assign the remaining tasks to the PID assignee. 
Don't change anything assigned to the social team. Make a Zendesk ticket and write the email with 
the booking link, sending it to the partner or client based on the order form. If it's a Vertical PID, send 
it as an internal note.

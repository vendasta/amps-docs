On the Day

Log into Bria first thing in the morning as coverage is limited on the day.

Send first responses and action and tickets that are urgent.

Frequently monitor triage and ensure all new tickets receive a first response.

Leave a message to colleagues with any queries or urgent matters, so that they can deal with them 
the first time the next business day. You can use the 'first response' macro for this. Always answer 
tickets saying you are covering since X is out of the o?ce.

End of Day

Make sure to log out of Bria

Last Triage check   assign any new tickets to the PID owner for immediate attention the next business 
day.

# The GBP Listing is suspended

When a listing is suspended. We would need:

a utility bill (name and address need to match the listing exactly)

storefront photos (business signage must be clear and visible)

business license

Send these to the listings team through VTM who will be able to submit a reinstatement request to 
Google.

Always inform the partner that this might take time as Google's response time is 2 3 business days

and this could take time to be processed.

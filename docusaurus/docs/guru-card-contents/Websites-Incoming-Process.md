# Websites Incoming Process

## Step by Step Workflow (For All Website Products)

### Find the order ticket

  Go to Zendesk, Order & Cancellations Triage
  Claim the relevant tickets
  Quick way to find all tickets: search the PID and sort by most recent

You can solve tickets using the **MS   Product Activation Email (Solve w/ No Survey)** macro.

### Assign yourself in Task Manager

  Open Task Manager and find the main website project
  Assign yourself to any tasks currently assigned to:
    COMMS TEAM
    COMMS LEADERS
  If Content & Creation form is submitted: send the developer or content call link
  If not submitted: request it in the confirmation email

### Review order information

  Inside the main Task Manager project, locate the:
    Order Form
    Fulfillment Form
  These forms typically contain:
    Partner/Client Contact Information
    Website details (template, nav, domain info, etc.)
    Any special instructions or add ons

### Create a Google Drive folder

  Go to: Websites 2.0 Shared Drive
  Locate the correct PID folder
  Inside that folder, create a new folder using the Business Name
  Upload any documentation from the fulfillment form (PDFs, attachments, notes)
  Copy the Drive folder link and paste it into the Task Manager Account Notes

### Send the confirmation email

  Use the appropriate macro in Zendesk to send the order confirmation
  Update the email manually to include:
    Business name
    Products ordered
    Any Add on Services (listed below)
    Booking link if the project requires a dev/content call: Booking Link

### Handle add ons if applicable

If the order includes:

  Additional Page(s)
  Additional Hour
  Advanced Ecommerce
  IDX Integration

Then:

  Add them to the Product Ordered line in the confirmation email
  Create or update tasks/projects in Task Manager accordingly

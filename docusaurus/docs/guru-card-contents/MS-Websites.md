## Website Pro Hosting Link
Topic: Please note the Website Pro Hosting Link is being blocked by Outlook.

Issue: Emails with the Website Pro Hosting Link attached to the thread are bouncing to users
who use Outlook email.

Solution: We have created a new staging domain "marketingservices.dev" to eliminate the
emails being blocked.

If a website pro hosting link is shared you can send the email by cusing a URL shortner _
https://www.shorturl.at/

Tip: All sites moving forward from February 13th, 2023 will be built on this domain. IF you have
a site that needs to be received prior to this date and has yet to hear back from the client or
rep, please reach out to the Website Support Team to transfer the site to the new domain.

## Markup File Creation
You must login to MarkUp using the websites@yourdigitalagents.com email.

CE team members will now be responsible for creating the MarkUp of the client's chosen
template prior to sending out the confirmation email for Templated Websites. This task has
been moved up in the VTM project and will now be assigned to the appropriate team member,
rather than a websites team member.

All MarkUps must be created in the following folder structure: Cohort &gt; PID &gt; SMB &gt; Website
Link. This will ensure the MarkUps are always easy to find and MarkUp is a lot cleaner.

There is a new feature in MarkUp that allows users to click a button to send an email and let us
know that they have finished entering their pins. If the MarkUp link is created with the
websites@yda email, it will come through in Zendesk. If it is created by logging in with your
personal yda email, the notification will go to you directly and will get lost.

All CE team members have been added to the MS Webslingers folder in JumpCloud in order to
provide access to the MarkUp login and any additional logins that you might need.

If you login to MarkUp and notice you have SMB MarkUp links that are not in their appropriate
folder, please take a couple of minutes to move them. It is extremely hard to find anything in
there right now so we're going to have the team start working on cleaning this up next week.
If you have some time to help, it would be greatly appreciated!

## Websites Onboarding Prep & Best Practices
This card is meant to follow up from our
 for all Client Engagement
Website Training Sessions
teams, so anything we've covered in those live sessions, you can find below! Now that we have
covered the basic Website information you need to know
 let's talk about best practices
HERE,
in your prep and calls.

First question that we must ask ourselves:

How do we prep for onboarding a website?

The best place for you to start you prep is none other than your VTM notes. See ref below.
⬇️

![](/img/guru/MS-Websites/30.png)

Rule of Thumb: If you're saying it on a call or an email—it should be in a public note. So, take a
look at the notes and see what you have already received from the partner in VTM.

• Look over the:

• Content,

• This includes the Content & Creation form!

MS_Websites / Website General Knowledge
• Are there any gaps in there? If you're not seeing things that need to be filled,

you need to ask for those!

• Old Website,

• Notes from the Website Team

Here's a link to the
 and the
to
Website Onboarding Script
Websites Bounceback Calling Script
help you with the wordage!

The
 is to analyze what we
 what the

goal of your prep
already have,
websites
 and what kind of
you need to ask to get
team needs,
 questions
the feel of what the client wants!

When you are done with your prep, it means that before your call—you have:

• Context

• Status of the order (what we have vs.what we need)

• Website Goals (what it looks like now vs. what they want it to look like)

• Questions to Ask

• Based on your research, you should know what kind of follow up questions

• ex. "I see that you have ordered a 10 page package, but your original website has

3 pages—how would you like to fill those pages?"

• ex. "We can't do this website pixel by pixel, but we do have a framework that is

close to what you want, would you want to take a look at that?"

The
end goal
 of your onboarding call is to make sure to get enough info from the client (who is
a decision maker) to build the
right
 website from the
FIRST
 time!

MS_Websites / Website General Knowledge
Now let's move on to
 to deliver the
Best Practices and Tips
best experiences for you and your partner/client.

What are some of the main goals that you should hit in your onboarding call?

Setting Expectations

• You need to be the leader in the call.

• Remember: You've got to work with both the client and the Websites team on

due dates and what was communicated

• You can't promise things that we do not offer, but always ensure that the

partners know you want to help find a solution.

• What does that look like? Lead the conversation.

• ex. "in order to do this.. we need this"

• Reiterate your understanding of what they are saying and clarify what you

need further from them

• Confirm due dates, and then explain the process of what happens afterwards

• ex. editing process, this is where explaining boundaries is important!

After the call, keep checking in with both parties—you've got to work with with both the client
and the Websites team on due dates and what what was communicated.

Aquire Content & Assets for our Websites Team

📝
 First thing— ensure that their
 is filled out.
Content and Creation Form

this is something you can do in your prep!

MS_Websites / Website General Knowledge
• this is also the audit order form task in each project VTM!
🔔

• If it is not completed, go through the form with the client on the call try to get as much

information as you can from them!

🎞️
 Please ensure that the client knows the importance of good quality images!

• Ask about the kind of brand image they want their business to have.

• What about the aesthetics?

• Who is the target audience for this website?

• Do we want this to look homey? Modern? Professional? Creative?

• For any niche businesses, express the importance of them sending images to us,

since there might not be many stock images to choose from

• ex. Medical Spa's, Electric Scooters,

🖥️
 UX—User Experience:

Get a feel for how they want

• Ask them about the customer journey:

• What do you want your customer to do on your website?

• What is the end goal of your website?

• What kind of experience do you want customers to have?

• What kind of information should they find?

• What should they know about you after looking through your website?

• Do you have any visual examples of your ideal website?

to Ask in a Website Onboard or Consult Call

🔗
 For anything else, look at our slides from the
Website Training Sessions!

Remember that you are the middle man—the advocate of the partner but
also the websites team!

Put yourself in both shoes and ask yourself:

• If I was a partner, what would I want the people creating my website to know?

• If I was creating a website, what would I like to know to ensure that I am creating a

website the client will be happy and satisfied with?

Your job is to collect that information and communicate clearly with both parties!

## IDX Integration
If you ever come across a website that has IDX integration listed and you have no idea what
that means, this is the card for you!!!!

This
 document here
 is for our Devs BUT it answers a lot of questions that we come across as
comms.

What is IDX?

• The plugin pulls in the information for display on the website. That plugin connects with
the Real Estate agent's MLS provider, which is where their and other real estate agents
properties are listed in a database. Each state or province has an MLS and these plugins
link the site with the MLS.

How will I know if it is a real estate website?

Typically it will be just like a regular website, but with a couple major pages and features
added such as _

• A Market (or Search) page or several depending on the demographic or market

• A Featured Properties widget _ typically on the homepage to highlight those properties

• An IDX plugin _ this is on the backend and pulls all of the information into the website for
the Real Estate Agent

MS_Websites / Website General Knowledge
What kind of things will I need to know:

The client is responsible for purchasing the subscription for the IDX plugin as well as the setup
with MLS. Once this has been completed (and usually approval is required by the client as
well), we will integrate the plugin into the website and set up the markets for display in the
widgets and pages. As a note, if the plugin is not completely finished by the client, we cannot
integrate or finish the site.

This is an add_on they need to purchase through Partner Center:

Here is their pricing page for an individual agent.

Here is their pricing page for a team & brokerage.

We recommend using iHomeFinder for all your IDX needs for a wide variety of reasons. They
have great features, can cover anything from commercial to residential listings (limited to
Canada and USA), can support multiple agents and MLS listings, and can provide listing
services for a wide array of markets. They also have excellent customer support.

Not a fan of iHomeFinder? Here are other choices we'd recommend:

• IDX Broker Platinum

• SHOWCASE IDX

• FLEX MLS

• RealtyNA

What is a Market Page?

MS_Websites / Website General Knowledge
A Market Page is typically a page dedicated to searching a specific area such as a city, suburb
or even zip code. What we are able to define as markets are based on what the MLS has
defined as a market. (See the limitations questions for more information.)

What is a widget?

This is a website development term that means the box/area where a Search form or map is
shown.

Customer. (if this status is not available set it to On Hold)

![](/img/guru/MS-Websites/34.png)

Please see Guru Card for directing SMBs and Partners to the
fulfillment form via Partner Center and Business App.
Onboarding Call & Summary _ Attend the onboard call with the Partner and
do over the
 and expectations with the processes.
Website onboard script
Retrieve any outstanding assets. State the due date of the website on the call.
If there is outstanding assets, let them know the due date of their Branded
Landing Page.

    e. MS_Websites / Website General Knowledge
After the onboard call is complete, fill out notes from the call in the
VTM project in VMKW and make sure to use the Call Note Template.
Send Post Onboard Email _ Send the Post Onboard Email to the Partner/SMB
outlining received assets, outstanding assets and the due date of the project.

    f. If there are still outstanding assets that prevent the production of the
website, give them a due date for a branded landing page (5 days
from order date) to be a placeholder until the assets are received and
production can begin.
Notify Fulfillment _ via Slack that onboard is completed and that updated
notes have been added to VTM. All notes need to be added to VTM project in

    g. VMKW.

Use the comment feature in VTM to tag the assigned website
developer.
If there is outstanding assets, keep the ticket in your own Zendesk
queue. Follow up on this every TWO days until all assets blocking the
build are received. Follow up on all outstanding assets every TWO
days. These are essential to the build and the sooner we receive
these, the sooner the client receives the finished website.
Once we have received all the outstanding assets, the website build
ticket will be transferred to the developer assigned to QA on the
project.
Send Publication Email _ The developers share the /?skip link and the
AdobeXD file with the assigned Comms person to send to the client. Use the
Macro Websites _ Publication Email.
Receive Revisions _ Follow up with the client every four business days until we
receive the edits back.

    i. Once the edits are received, update the notes in the Complete edit

and Receive Revision tasks and assign the ticket to the developer
assigned to QA.
The developers will complete the changes in 5 business days.
Send Website Support Transition Email _ After edits are completed, the
website support transition email is sent to the client/partner and the website
enters into the support phase.
Transition to Support _ Once all other tasks are completed, Transition to

Support task can be closed out in VTM with proper notes made on the task.

WEBSITE SUPPORT

Agency Website _ The agency website requires support for the first month, but the partner is
responsible for deactivating it if they don't want it. Support products continue to roll over
month over month until someone deactivates them.

Landing Page _ For landing pages, support is totally optional! Should they need anything past
the first round of revisions, we would ask that they activate the LP Support add_on, but
support is optional for this product and not required if they don't need it

Up_to 3/5/10 page website _ Website Support is included for a 1 year with the website product
purchase.

Onboarding Questions for WooCommerce
How many products will you be adding to your store?

_ 5 products
Website Up to 3

_ 15 products
Website Up to 5

_ 25 products
Website Up 10

This is to gauge if they need to activate additional products. You can also let them know we
can provide instructions so they can add products themselves if they would like to go with that
option.

MS_Websites / Website General Knowledge
Make sure they're aware for variable products, every variable is considered a separate
product. For example if you have a product named T_shirt, with 2 color variables of red and
blue. Those are considered 3 products:

3. T_shirt (parent variable)
T_shirt red (child variation)
T_shirt blue (child variation)

What payment Processor are you using?

• We offer Stripe, Square, and Paypal integration for free. Others will be quoted out.

• Square_ If they have an online and a physical store. You are able to keep track of
the in_store inventory and online. This is called a POS (Point of Sale System), which
is an application that allows store owners to sell online products in brick_and_

mortar stores, seamlessly. It turns any modern web browser into a cash register,
allowing you to holistically manage your products, orders and customers. The
downfall is they have to manage online sales to ensure that they are not running
out of products.

• Stripe_ Most commonly used. Stripe also has POS (point of sale system).

• PayPal_ This is more commonly used. The downfall of this is people will need a
PayPal Account. Good for first_time eCommerce stores.

What is your shipping fee? We offer the integration of flat rate fees, free shipping, and basic
local pickup (one location) for free. Others will be quoted out.

What are your tax rates? Right now we only offer adding USA and Canada tax rates. Complex
tax rates will need to be quoted out.

MS_Websites / Website General Knowledge
What locations are you selling and shipping to?
Ask these questions so that you can relay this to the developers. (Canada, SK, etc.)

Do you have a Privacy Policy, terms and conditions, shipping & FAQs? We recommend having
at least a Privacy policy page but we CANNOT create one for them or give advice for liability
reasons. We recommend using a privacy policy generator if they need assistance (They can
google one or you can provide them with a link)

If you are on the call and the partner asks for additional functionality!?

Ensure that you take detailed notes of what they are asking for and confirm that they send
over the information via email. After that you can reference the
to see what
plugin document
you believe they would be quoted. Bring all of this information to the QA developer and they
will confirm with you how many additional hours they believe need to be working on! Once the
quote is confirmed that can be brought to the partner.

Definitions:

• POS (point of sale): web_based point of sale (POS) application that allows store owners to
sell online products in brick_and_mortar stores, seamlessly. It turns any modern web
browser into a cash register, allowing you to holistically manage your products, orders
and customers.

• Simple – covers the vast majority of any products you may sell. Simple products are
shipped and have no options. For example, a book.

• Grouped – a collection of related products that can be purchased individually and only
consist of simple products. For example, a set of six drinking glasses.

• MS_Websites / Website General Knowledge
Virtual – one that doesn't require shipping. For example, a service. Enabling this, disables
all shipping related fields such as shipping dimensions. A virtual product will also not
trigger the shipping calculator in cart and checkout.

• Downloadable – activates additional fields where you can provide a downloadable file.
After a successful purchase, customers are given a downloadable file as a link in the
order notification email. This is suitable, for example, for a digital album, PDF magazine,
or photo.

• External or Affiliate – one that you list and describe on your website but is sold
elsewhere.

Variable – a product with variations, each of which may have a different SKU, price, stock
option, etc. For example, a t_shirt available in different colors and/or sizes.

## Adding a video to a website

image. If you're trying to set an MP4 as a background, here's what you can do:

1. USE DIVI'S BUILT_IN VIDEO BACKGROUND FEATURE
:

Divi provides an easy way to set video backgrounds directly from the Visual Builder.

STEPS:

1. Open the Page in Divi Builder:

• Go to the section, row, or module where you want to add the video background.

2. Edit the Section/Row/Module Settings:

• Hover over the section/row/module and click on the gear icon to open the

settings.

different types of backgrounds (Color, Gradient, Image, Video).

• Click on the
 option (it looks like a filmstrip icon).
Video

• Upload or select the MP4 file from your media library.

video backgrounds.

6. Save and Publish:

• After setting the video, save the changes and publish the page.

## Harvard Website Process
During the onboarding call, Dev (Jireh Wong) will be present to assist with these calls.

We will gather all the information needed to build the site. We won't provide a due date until
after the initial call once the devs have a chance to review everything.

We will deliver a first mock of the homepage within 7 business days to the Reps. Before
delivering the first mock, comms and a website leader will QA the site. If any changes need to
be made it will be sent back to the devs to make changes.

Once delivered to the Harvard rep, the rep will schedule a review call with the client, comms,
and dev. During the review call, we will go over any changes the client would like to see and
will get approval if we can proceed with the rest of the site.

Another due date is given for the 2nd phase of the site. Once the devs have completed the 2nd
phase of the site. Comms and Website leaders QA the site one last time before final delivery to
the reps.

There is one final round of revisions before the site goes to website support and goes live.

MS_Websites / CE Website Processes
## Handling old website project tickets
You might often come across tickets with update or revision on an older project that is
completed or closed after the completion of website bounceback process.

In this case, you can follow this checklist to process it correctly:

Step 1: Search the original archived ticket (you can use PID, AGID, Business Name or Partner
Name as keywords) and read all the notes.

Step 2: Find the project thread in ms_incoming channel in slack, using AGID.

• Check the last update on the project.

• Note the developer working on it. (You can find it at the beginning of the thread)

Step 3: Update the team with latest information and ticket number and check if the project can
be reopened.

• Be sure to tag the developer of the project for a timely response

• In case of delay, you can also join Techtalk all_day hangout to get clarity from the team.

Step 4: Responding to the ticket

Scenario_1: If partner/client has sent an asset, verify them and upload in the main drive
located in VTM.

• Search the website project in VMKA using AGID in the Completed Projects.

MS_Websites / CE Website Processes
![](/img/guru/MS-Websites/43.png)

• Go to any task and look in Project Description.

• Upload the asset (pictures, document, links, etc.) in that drive.

![](/img/guru/MS-Websites/44.png)

• Thank the partner/client of providing assets, revise the due date to 2 days later and

submit the ticket as on_hold.

Scenario_2: No assets are received but partner/client has reached out to reopen the project.

• Confirm the list of assets with the development team.

• Ask for them on email.

MS_Websites / CE Website Processes
• Also share the markup file link for any potential edits and the last publication mock link

created to make sure they know at which point the project was stopped.

• Revise the due date to 2 days later and submit the ticket as pending.

Step 4: Creating VTM Tasks

• If you received all the missing assets required for the project, go to VTM and create a

task called Website Support Request under the old project.

• Put an internal note with PID, AGID and brief information on the request.

• Assign the ticket to MS _ Website Support by selecting proper Tier and appropriate due

date.

• Refer this
ensure proper due date and Tier in your ticket and VTM tasks.
link

• Change the ticket due date to current date and submit it as open.

Step 5: Project is Re_opening from Revisions Stage

• Go to VTM and update the notes and link to XD file containing the revisions. (you can out

these comments yourself based on partner/client's requests)

• Update the slack thread and remind them that all recurring tasks will need re_opening.

## What information to collect for domain access
When collecting domain information for a website build or email marketing, make sure you're
collecting the following information and communicating it to the fulfillment team in Vendasta
Task Manager (VTM).

1. Collect the domain name. A domain name is like a website's home address, for

example google.com. The team needs it to make sure the right domain name is

connected to the website and to finish things like Google Recaptcha and domain

authentication for email marketing.

Domain Name _

2. Collect the domain registrar. A domain registrar is like a store where you buy website

names. If a domain name is like a home address for a website, the registrar is the

place where you go to get and manage that address. We need certain information

based on the domain registrar. See below:

This card is meant to follow up from our
 for all Client Engagement
Website Training Sessions
teams, so anything we've covered in those live sessions, you can find below! Now that we have
covered the basic Website information you need to know
 let's talk about best practices
HERE,
in your prep and calls.

First question that we must ask ourselves:

How do we prep for onboarding a website?

The best place for you to start you prep is none other than your VTM notes. See ref below.
⬇️

![](/img/guru/MS-Websites/73.png)

Rule of Thumb: If you're saying it on a call or an email—it should be in a public note. So, take a
look at the notes and see what you have already received from the partner in VTM.

• Look over the:

• Content,

• This includes the Content & Creation form!

MS_Websites / Website Design & Builds
• Are there any gaps in there? If you're not seeing things that need to be filled,

you need to ask for those!

• Old Website,

• Notes from the Website Team

Here's a link to the
 and the
to
Website Onboarding Script
Websites Bounceback Calling Script
help you with the wordage!

The
 is to analyze what we
 what the

goal of your prep
already have,
websites
 and what kind of
you need to ask to get
team needs,
 questions
the feel of what the client wants!

When you are done with your prep, it means that before your call—you have:

• Context

• Status of the order (what we have vs.what we need)

• Website Goals (what it looks like now vs. what they want it to look like)

• Questions to Ask

• Based on your research, you should know what kind of follow up questions

• ex. "I see that you have ordered a 10 page package, but your original website has

3 pages—how would you like to fill those pages?"

• ex. "We can't do this website pixel by pixel, but we do have a framework that is

close to what you want, would you want to take a look at that?"

The
end goal
 of your onboarding call is to make sure to get enough info from the client (who is
a decision maker) to build the
right
 website from the
FIRST
 time!

MS_Websites / Website Design & Builds
Now let's move on to
 to deliver the
Best Practices and Tips
best experiences for you and your partner/client.

What are some of the main goals that you should hit in your onboarding call?

Setting Expectations

• You need to be the leader in the call.

• Remember: You've got to work with both the client and the Websites team on

due dates and what was communicated

• You can't promise things that we do not offer, but always ensure that the

partners know you want to help find a solution.

• What does that look like? Lead the conversation.

• ex. "in order to do this.. we need this"

• Reiterate your understanding of what they are saying and clarify what you

need further from them

• Confirm due dates, and then explain the process of what happens afterwards

• ex. editing process, this is where explaining boundaries is important!

After the call, keep checking in with both parties—you've got to work with with both the client
and the Websites team on due dates and what what was communicated.

Aquire Content & Assets for our Websites Team

📝
 First thing— ensure that their
 is filled out.
Content and Creation Form

this is something you can do in your prep!

MS_Websites / Website Design & Builds
• this is also the audit order form task in each project VTM!
🔔

• If it is not completed, go through the form with the client on the call try to get as much

information as you can from them!

🎞️
 Please ensure that the client knows the importance of good quality images!

• Ask about the kind of brand image they want their business to have.

• What about the aesthetics?

• Who is the target audience for this website?

• Do we want this to look homey? Modern? Professional? Creative?

• For any niche businesses, express the importance of them sending images to us,

since there might not be many stock images to choose from

• ex. Medical Spa's, Electric Scooters,

🖥️
 UX—User Experience:

Get a feel for how they want

• Ask them about the customer journey:

• What do you want your customer to do on your website?

• What is the end goal of your website?

• What kind of experience do you want customers to have?

• What kind of information should they find?

• What should they know about you after looking through your website?

• Do you have any visual examples of your ideal website?

 For anything else, look at our slides from the
Website Training Sessions!

Remember that you are the middle man—the advocate of the partner but
also the websites team!

Put yourself in both shoes and ask yourself:

• If I was a partner, what would I want the people creating my website to know?

• If I was creating a website, what would I like to know to ensure that I am creating a

website the client will be happy and satisfied with?

Your job is to collect that information and communicate clearly with both parties!

## MS Bounce_back / Fulfillment Audit Process
Bounce_backs are our way of checking up on projects where Partners/SMB's have become
unresponsive.

For unresponsiveness with ongoing projects/services _ if we cannot fulfill their paid service,
please discuss with your manager to determine the best route forward.

REMEMBER, THE GOAL IS TO ENSURE WE'RE ACTIVELY FULFILLING SERVICES FOR ANY PAYING
ACCOUNTS.

Background:

To reduce the number of credits being issued for non_start projects (due to outstanding
assets, account access, etc), we are implementing a proactive approach to audit projects
before their 1st renewal date to identify if we are fulfilling the services partners have
contracted us to complete. If not, we will notify partners and account managers prior, and if
we're still unable to begin work, we reccomend cancelling the product.

There will be a Task Manager task added to all projects tied to a Marketing Services SKU with a
due date of 20 days after the date of purchase. The task will kick off the following process:

1. Client Engagement will audit the order/project to confirm whether or not fulfillment

has begun (or is on track to begin before the renewal date)

    a. If
 close the task with relevant notes and proceed as normal.
the answer is yes,

    b. If
, follow the steps below:
the answer is no

2. Identify the current blockers preventing our team from fulfilling the services paid for.

MS_Websites / Website Design & Builds
3. Loop in your respective Manager/Team Lead and fulfillment leaders to proceed.

4. (Upon confirmation from step 3, proceed to step 5)

5. Notify the Account Manager for the PID in question in the ms_support_team GChat

Channel with the blockers and that they need to cancel the services or provide

required assets.

6. Create a ticket with communications to the partner with the outstanding

requirements and next steps.

7. Leave notes in Task Manager of the steps taken thus far and update the Due Date to

5 Business Days before the renewal date.

8. On the 5th day before renewal, review the account to see if we are now able to begin

fulfillment.

    a. If
 close the task with relevant notes and proceed as normal.
the answer is yes,

    b. If
, follow the steps below:
the answer is no

9. Send a final email to the Partner and Account Manager letting them know the

account will not be getting services and they should cancel services until they are

ready to begin.

10. Provide a summary in the project notes in Task Manager.

((Email/Macro templates on next page))

## Delivering Sites Without Templates
If a site is ordered and a Template is not chosen, our team will deliver a temporary Landing
Page in place of the full site. When sending the first mock email:

1. Use the macro Websites: Publication Email [Waiting on Template]

    a. Add the bounceback tag and set the ticket to PENDING

    b. Follow the typical bounceback process.

2. Once the client chooses the template, re_open all 3x Content tasks in VTM. Tag the

writer + Aishwariya in the Comments and let them know the template has been

chosen.

    a. Adjust the due date of the content tasks to reflect the new timeline

    i. 500 words: 2 days + 1 for Edit task

    ii. 1000 words: 4 days + 1 for Edit task

    iii. 2000 words: 5 days + 1 for Edit task

    b. Reopen the Build Website First Mock task in VTM and tag the Developer and QA

person in the comments to let them know the template has been chosen

    c. Adjust the due date of the build publication mock to reflect the new timeline for

delivery

    d. Email the Partner/Client with the new delivery date.

    i. Assign the ticket to the Developer.

MS_Websites / Website Design & Builds
    ii. Submit it as OPEN

    e. Reopen the "Publication Mock QA and Approval" task in VTM

MS_Websites / Website Design & Builds
## Sending a First Mock Email
When the website has been built by the Developers and has been QA'd by their team, it is
ready to be sent to the Partner/SMB.

1. The Developer will notify you via VTM project comments with a note that contains all

of the information for the site (click each link to ensure that they work before

sending):

1. The first link is the link to the temporary domain for the site.

2. The second link is for an MarkUp document where Partners/Clients can note any

changes to the site.

3. Select the appropriate First Mock Email macro in Zendesk:

    a. Websites: First Mock Email [List Outstanding Assets] is to be sent if we still

require assets from the Partner in order to complete the site (as seen above)

    b. Websites: First Mock Email [No Outstanding Assets] is to be sent if we have

everything we need for the site and nothing is outstanding

    c. Websites: First Mock Email [Waiting on Template] is to be sent when the Partner

/Client has not chosen a template for their site yet.

MS_Websites / Website Design & Builds
    i. In this case we are just delivering a Landing Page to them, but whenever

they choose the template we can build out the rest of the site for them. (see

specific instructions below)

4. Fill in the Bolded and bracketed sections to reflect the project you are working on:

    a. Double check the contact name

    b. SMB_NAME is the Account Name

    c. SKIP_CACHE_LINK is the Temporary Domain link

    d. MARK_UP_LINK is the MarkUp link

    e. List any outstanding assets provided in the internal note from the Developer.

    f. Pick the booking link of the communication person assigned to the project

(check who is assigned to the project in VTM if you are unsure), and remove the

rest.

5. Assign the ticket to the Comms Person in charge of the project if not already.

    a. Add the tag: Bounceback

    b. Platform, Product, and Service: Website Creation

    c. Classification: Fulfillment &gt; Follow_Up

    d. Type: Task

    e. Due date: 4 days in the future

6. Submit the ticket as PENDING as we are now waiting on the Partner/SMB to get back

to us with edits on their site!

7. Update the "Send Publication Email" task in VTM:

MS_Websites / Website Design & Builds
    a. Private note: "Initials _ Date: Publication email sent."

    b. Status: Complete

MS_Websites / Website Design & Builds
Good Questions to Ask in a Website Onboard or
Consult Call

SMB Name:

• Make sure you have the name ready for the business that you are taking the call for. You

don't want to mix up with any other calls you are having that day.

• Make sure you know which partner the call is for. Sometimes the call is with the client

and we are representing the partner.

• Get information about the plugins on what they are looking for. If you don't have

enough time, let the partner/client know that you will need additional time to research

about the plugin.

Domain Credentials:

• Check the order form if the credentials are already provided.

• Do they own a domain? If so, provide credentials.

• Do we need to purchase a domain on their behalf?

• Do they have a domain name preference?

Framework: (
https://frameworks.yourdigitalagents.com
)

• Did they select a framework? If yes, go over the framework.

MS_Websites / Website Design & Builds
• Are you selecting one during the call? Select a few before the call that goes with their

business. This will showcase that you are well prepared for the call.

#pages:

• Check the order form to see if the navigation is provided.

Navigation:

• Go over the navigation items

• For landing page, we don't add anchor links.

• Suggestions if they are running out of page limit and don't want to purchase additional

page:

• Contact page to be an anchor link to the footer

• FAQs/Testimonials can be added as sections on a page

Logo:

• Did they provide us with a logo?

• If not, ask for an original copy of logo, preferably as an EPS, JPEG, or PNG format.

• If not, add the business name as a logo on the site.

Color scheme:

• Check the order form if there are any likes or dislikes, any color scheme provided or

preference.

MS_Websites / Website Design & Builds
• If not, use the colors from the logo.

• If there is no logo, check out what kind of business it is and search for a color palette.

Font choice:

• Do they have a font preference?

• TIP: If there is a font in the logo, use that for the headers and find a font pairing with

that font.

Images:

• Did they provide us the images? A dropbox or drive link in the order form? Is the link

accessible? If not, ask for the access.

• Suggest
 and ask them to provide with the image ID (Please
https://www.123rf.com/

note: Make sure that you provide them with the correct number of images that are

included in their website build product)

• Basically 5 images per page (Up to 3 Page: 15 images, Up to 5 Page: 25 images, Up to 10

Page: 50 images)

Videos:

• Did they provide us with any videos? A dropbox or drive link in the order form? Is the link

accessible? If not, ask for the access.

• TIP: If they want to add a whole lot of videos, suggest adding the videos to a YouTube

playlist and embed that to the site. This will not hinder the site speed.

MS_Websites / Website Design & Builds
Icons:

• Did they provide us with any icons? A dropbox or drive link in the order form? Is the link

accessible? If not, ask for the access.

• Suggest
 and ask them to provide with the image ID.
https://www.flaticon.com/

Web Copy:

• Any thing worth mentioning to the copy team about the content on the site.

• Usually the info is provided in the order form but if not, then ask if there is anything the

copy team should be aware of while creating the content.

• Can we grab content from their current site.

• Any text that the client/partner would like/not like to add to their site.

NAP data:

• Make sure we have the info below

• Name

• Email

• Phone Number

• Address

• Hours of Operation

Social media:

• Would they like to add any other social media links to the site?

MS_Websites / Website Design & Builds
• Again, this one is usually provided in the order form.

Contact form:

• Fields: Are there any additional fields

• Submission email

Embed a Map:

• Do they want to showcase their location as a map on the site?

• Some business don't have a physical location, so please make sure you ask about this.

E_commerce:

• Product CSV File: We need a completed product csv file in order to create an eCommerce

website!

• Product CSV Import Schema:

• https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/wiki/Product_CSV_Import_

Schema#csv_columns_and_formatting

• Additional information on the products:

• https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/managing_products/

• Payment gateway processor: We suggest PayPal, Stripe, or Square for payment gateway.

We'll need login credentials or the API keys.

• Shipping zones: What locations are you selling and shipping to?

MS_Websites / Website Design & Builds
• Shipping fee: We offer the integration of flat rate fees, free shipping, and basic local

pickup (one location) for free.

• Tax rates: Right now we only offer adding USA and Canada tax rates. This is something

that the client needs to have figured out before we begin!

• Privacy Policy: We recommend at least having a privacy policy page but we can't create

one due to liability reasons. We recommend using a privacy policy generator if you need

assistance (you can simply google for a privacy generator or can use this link

to create one)
https://www.termsfeed.com/privacy_policy_generator/

• Variable products are not counted as a single product but it's variations are.

• ex. For up_to 10 page website so we can upload up to 25 products to the site.

• Please note 25 products means it is for simple 25 products. If it is a variable product

meaning different sizes or colors, each size and color would be it's own product.

• ex. if one item has 3 sizes, it will be counted as 3 products. If they have sizes as

well as colors. Now this means if there are 3 sizes and 3 colors it would be 9

products.

Privacy policy:

• Do they have a privacy policy?

• We recommend at least having a privacy policy page but we can't create one due to

liability reasons. We recommend using a privacy policy generator if you need assistance

(you can simply google for a privacy generator or can use this link
https://www.

to create one)
termsfeed.com/privacy_policy_generator/

functionality is mentioned in the order form)

• Some examples:

• Review widgets

• Marketplace

Can we change the Framework after the First
Mock stage?

Yes, we sure can. One Home Page redesign is permitted after delivery of the first mock if it
does not meet your vision. Please note that additional charges will be incurred to change the
template after the first mock delivery, or if additional pages besides the Home Page were
delivered in your first mock.

Example:

For 3 pages = 3 Additional Hours

FYI: If they require new plugins, copy, etc... please confirm with the Website team. These will
be additional charges on top of the hours for the Framework swap!

Hosting Domain Change for Marketing Services
Websites

If you are having issues with the current websitepro.hosting domain please submit a ticket to
Marketing Services Website Support Team. Once this has been submitted MS_Website Support
will create a marketingservices.dev domain and set the site to the primary domain for this site.

1. Please create a Tier 1 task in VMKW Task Manager labeled

Website Support Request T1

4. In this task provide us with the AGID that needs to be changed.
Assign both task and ticket to Website Support with a next day due date.
Submit as On_Hold.

MS_Websites / Website Support

Example:

The partner has a customer who is looking to pause hosting, but then resume it at a later date.
What would be the best way to achieve this?

Answer:

The best approach would be to export the files in case they pause for longer than 3 months. If
the pause is less than 3 months, we can just reactivate Website pro and not have any issues. If
you think it will be longer than that, send a request for the website files to be exported and
then send them to the partner.

We will have a copy too but I would give them a copy to be responsible for.

## How to connect a CloudFlare Managed Domain
Cloudflare is a very popular and useful service at both paid and free subscription levels. Some
businesses or agencies use it as a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to cache static files and get
their site loading faster, others just prefer to have a single nameserver to manage their
Domain Name System (DNS) configurations.

Because of some of it's features there are some steps you'll have to follow to add any
Cloudflare managed domain to your site in Website Pro:

1. Ensure your DNS Records (relevant A and CNAME records) are configured as

.
explained here

2. In the "Crypto" tab of Cloudflare change the "SSL" to Full

3. In the "Crypto" tab of Cloudflare change "Always use HTTPS" to Off

4. In Website Pro, add the domain(s) in the Domains tab. Note: There might be some

propagation delay for those records. See the
 article for more
DNS Record Caching

information about that.

5. In the "Crypto" tab of Cloudflare change "Always use HTTPS" to
, when the status of
On

the domain(s) is "connected" in Website Pro.

Note
: Unfortunately CloudFlare has some technical limitations if you are using a four level
domain (like "www
.
your
.
business
.
com")  that can be solved in one of two ways:

1. Turn off the
 mode for that domain, or
DNS and HTTP Proxy

MS_Websites / Website Support
2.  Purchase additional SSL Certificates for CloudFlare under the "Crypto" tab under the

"Edge Certificates &gt; Order SSL Certificate" section.

## Troubleshooting Website Imports
The following are some things to check for if you are having issues with a website during or
post Import.

PRE/DURING IMPORT TROUBLESHOOTING

• We cannot import multi sites!!

• Do we have access to the domains/dns?

• We need to make sure that we have this access BEFORE we start the import, as we
cannot set the site live on our hosting without these credentials.

• Are some pages created under Appearance in WordPress?

• This is out of scope for us and we cannot support this. We should be trying to
catch items like this in the vetting stage.

POST IMPORT TROUBLESHOOTING

• Check for leftover files from the old hosting provider.

• Is a plugin not working? Check to see if the license transferred or not.

## Ecwid Products Import Doc
We need 1 file and 1 zip consists of Images. If their is any variations than another additional
file is required.

• Products List File (
Sample
)

Mandatory steps to import products

The file to upload products needs to be alphabetical order. If any of the products have any
numbers at the beginning than it should start as:

.

.

A

B

C

D

MS_Websites / eCommerce

.

.

X

Y

Z

2. Product Zip File (
Sample
) _ Consisting of Images. It is mandatory to have a copy of the

same images with a unique name, if the image is used for product variation purposes.

For example,

Main Product: Image.jpg

Variation 1: Image1.jpg

Variation 2: Image2.jpg

To import the images, it is mandatory to complete step 3.

3. After importing the Product File, simply export the file having the columns mentioned

below.

Name, SKU, Product_Id.

MS_Websites / eCommerce
We are exporting because when you import the products, we will not have the product ID
which is system generated values after an import is completed.

4. Once the file is downloaded, add another column image. Send that file to the client to

fill up the image name with their extension.

For example,
Image.jpg

If the file extension is missing or the extension is not the same as the file that is present under
the zip file then the image will not upload. For example, Image/Images.png/Images.jpeg and
vice versa will not work. If the file is .png then make sure that the file .png is also present in
the zip file.

If you like us to complete that step, simply activate 1x hour for 100 products.

5. Also, make sure to never use the same image name for other products in the same

file.

6. Products Variation File (
Sample
)

Once the variations are imported, export the file to add the name present in the

file. Follow the same step for adding images in a zip file for
sample_image.zip

variations.

## e_Commerce: CSV:_ What is needed
• Product CSV File: We need a completed product csv file. Please find the attached Sample
CSV File.

• Product CSV Import Schema:
https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/wiki
/Product_CSV_Import_Schema#csv_columns_and_formatting

• Additional information on the products:
https://docs.woocommerce.com/document
/managing_products/

• Payment gateway processor: We suggest PayPal, Stripe, or Square for payment gateway.
We'll need login credentials or the API keys.

• Shipping zones: What locations are you selling and shipping to?

• Shipping fee: We offer the integration of flat rate fees, free shipping, and basic local
pickup (one location) for free.

• Tax rates: Right now we only offer adding USA and Canada tax rates.

• Privacy Policy: We recommend at least having a privacy policy page but we can't create
one due to liability reasons. We recommend using a privacy policy generator if you need

MS_Websites / eCommerce
assistance (you can simply google for a privacy generator or can use this link

to create one)
https://www.termsfeed.com/privacy_policy_generator/

• Variable products are not counted as a single product but it's variations are. For example
_ For upto 10 page website so we can upload up to 25 products to the site. Please note
25 products means it is for simple 25 products. If it is a variable product meaning
different sizes or colors, each size and color would be it's own product. _ for example, if
one item has 3 sizes, it will be counted as 3 products. If they have sizes as well as colors.
Now this means if there are 3 sizes and 3 colors it would be 9 products.

MS_Websites / Website Product FAQ's
## Are our websites ADA Compliant?
Our websites are not ADA compliant, only ADA pursuant. We do not guarantee compliance for
any of our website builds, because that dives into the legal side of things. Each business and
each city, state, province may have additional legislation. That will be up to the partner or SMB
to know and comply with.

We have/ can add the following plugins to help with pursuance:

• One_Click Accessibility

• Divi Accessibility

A website being ADA pursuant means:

• Overall Accessibility features:

• Metadata for each page _ adds description of page (Yoast SEO)

• Ability to increase/decrease font size

• Ability to change to a readable font

• Captions on all videos (clients must agree to put videos on youtube for this function)

• Alt tags for all photos

• Color contrast

• Negative contrast

• Light background

• Links underlined

MS_Websites / Website Product FAQ's
• Ability to tab through menu and website

Using Divi Accessibility adds the following features:

• Adds appropriate ARIA attributes

• Improved keyboard navigation in menus

• Fixes missing & incorrectly assigned labels

• Makes modules such as Toggle & Accordion focusable and keyboard interactive

• Adds a visual outline to focusable elements for keyboard only navigation

• Ability to change keyboard only outline color

• Fixes Divi incorrectly using screen reader classes

• Adds skip navigation link optimized for Divi markup

• Hide icons from screen readers which can affect reading of text

• Fix duplicate menu IDs

If the Partner/ Client needs ADA compliance, we have a product in the Vendasta Marketplace
called

AudioEye
. This will give them a tool to check and supports legal compliance specific to their
local region.

When Partners Provide Web Copy to be Formatted to fit the

MS_Websites / Website Product

FAQ's

Framework

When Partners Provide Web Copy to be
Formatted to fit the Framework

When dealing with projects where the clients provide us with a large volume of copy to add in
their sites, we can rework the copy to fit the framework and input it into the site. If the client is
providing their own copy without formatting it according to the framework, we can format
twice the amount of words they would normally get with their website product.

• For a 3_page site, we can format up to 1000 words,

• 5 page site_ we can copy_paste up to 2000 words

• 10 page site_ we can format up to 4000 words

We've added these details in the FAQ section of the product information. If a client wants to
provide more copy than the mentioned limit, they can format it according to the framework
and provide it to us or buy additional copy for us to work with.

The mobile speed of my site is slow, can you fix
this?

We have added a lazy loader and image optimizer to your site, the image optimizer will
continue to work in the background, so any images you add will automatically be optimized.
These updates will increase your speed, however, please note that the speed you are seeing in
your dashboard is pulled in from how your site would load on the oldest software available,
thus, the speed will always show slower than what your site's speed actually is.

To get a better idea of your website's speed, you can test your URL on a speed test site like this
one:
.
https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/

I've run the optimization tests again and the speed has improved on our end. If you open your
website on a desktop and also on mobile are you getting different speed results? It's not
always reliable to base your results on page insights alone. There are many factors involved
that result in bad scores, i.e. how many apps are open on your pc or phone, is the wifi or cell
network your on bogged down or have a bad signal, is the pc or phone old or new?

I ran your website on my phone and desktop and getting decent response times. Please let me
know if there are specific concerns and I'd be happy to look into them. However, I flushed the
cache and optimized all images again just in case.

MS_Websites / Website Product FAQ's
## Can I have the review widget added to my site?
Yes, you can! Please activate and set up Reputation Management Pro and the Review Display
Widget Pro add_on. If you need any assistance with this please reach out to [Their Partner
Development Manager (PDR)]. We'll need the widget code to add it to the website.

If you would like us to add Google reviews via a plugin, we just need the business name
(matching the GBP listing) and we can use the Trustindex plugin.

With the Trustindex plugin, the free version doesn't automatically update the reviews. You
have to go in and refresh it (and we think you can only do it once every 2 weeks with the free
version.) Refreshing it is quite simple, it's something like "Show latest reviews." There would be
more options with a paid version.

The Trustindex version will look something like this on a website:

get it fixed?

My site is really slow on mobile. Is there a reason
for this and can we get it fixed?

There can be a number of reasons for a site being slow. First and foremost, Google Page
Speed Insights uses an old phone on a slow network to determine the site speeds, which
means that sites will always score low. As for specifics, this can help improve your sites speed:

• On your homepage, do not use sliders or videos as they take a while to load

• Divi will slow down a site, but it is also the most powerful and versatile theme, which is
why we use it

• Tons of plugins _ if there is a way to do something without a plugin that is usually
preferable such as duplicating pages (built into Divi, no need for a plugin). Also if you
need a plugin for a specific one_time use and you're not using it for ongoing
functionality, then deactivate the plugin and delete it.

Beyond that, when your site goes to Website Support, we can add 10Web once you create an
account. (if not already added)

PRBS _ Unique work flow for Website Orders.

They will be doing the calls on their own and we just have to start the website without an
onboarding call.

time because they will be telling the due date to the client and if that is not going to sent to
them on that date it will create a problem on their end.

And please note for all the websites we should not tell them the due date until we have every
assets to build a website.

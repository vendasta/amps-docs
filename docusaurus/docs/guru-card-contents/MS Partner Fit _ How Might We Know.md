# MS Partner Fit How Might We Know

Before proceeding with the steps outlined below, we need to start coaching the team on identifying

misaligned expectations during 1 on 1s and team syncs. This includes building their confidence to

recognize and address these situations when they arise. We'll plan to meet with the team to review

these triggers, encouraging them to stay alert and escalate any occurrences to their manager every

time.

Red Flag / "Not a Fit" Triggers:

•
 Misaligned expectations: Partner expectations exceed what your services can realistically deliver.

•
 Resource mismatch: The partner requires capabilities or bandwidth your team doesn't have.

•
 Poor communication: The partner demonstrates challenges in collaboration or responsiveness or

simply doesn't want to be involved at all.

•
 Misaligned values or abuse: The partner's goals, ethics, or approach conflict with your

organization's.

•
 Profitability concerns: Supporting the partner isn't financially viable.

Escalation Workflow: (for when a partner meets one or many of the criteria above):

Internal Review Within MS:

Team/individual identifies a potential issue and documents examples (emails, meeting

notes, feedback).

First time: IC tries to reset expectations.

Second time: Manager tries to reset expectations.

Manager determines if we continue on flow or if the red flag is an issue that we

can take ownership of and improve our workflows.

Third time: VP gets involved and continues on with flow below.

VP and Manager find out potential revenue and sku risk.

VP/sr manager create a meeting with GM.

Escalation to Sales:

VP & GM schedules meeting with Sales Director(s) to discuss red flags

VP documents red flags and decision point via email, looping in all stakeholders above.

Decision Point:

If fixable: Define clear actions to reset expectations and improve alignment along with a

set review period to ensure partnership is still working (e.g., renegotiate terms, clarify

deliverables).

If not fixable: Agree to disengage and schedule meeting with partner.

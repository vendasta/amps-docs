# Instagram Page Build

So team Instagram Page is very simple to create but since we use System we will try to create it through System or Laptop.

Once getting inside you fill up these rows and click on signup the instagram.com and click on Sign Up. OTP will be sent to that number which you have entered here.

But to be honest the OTP never comes if you are creating the Instagram through Lap or System.

**There is another easy way to do it.**

Just use your mobile. Get inside the Instagram application, click on Sign Up. It will ask only the username and password. If you enter both the information it will be created without any OTP.

Once it is done you can put the same credentials which you used to create in your laptop by getting to Instagram.com. Now it will be opened.

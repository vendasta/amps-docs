# Process for unsuccessful video verification for Listings

* The listing team contacts Google in case of unsuccessful video verification, seeking alternate

verification methods, or reinstating suspended listings. Listing team communication aims to

address various listing related issues promptly and effectively. This ensures smooth listing

management and compliance with Google's guidelines.

* We consistently pass project updates to our partners whenever we receive them from the team.

This ensures transparent communication of the project's progress.

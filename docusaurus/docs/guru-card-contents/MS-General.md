## Customer Service Best Practices
1. KNOW YOUR PRODUCT

As a customer support agent, you spend all day troubleshooting for customers, and that
means you need to be a product expert.

Expansive knowledge of your product is an essential customer service skill. Ideally, you should
believe in your product, be able to discuss features and use cases in an insightful way, and
show your customers how the product can benefit them — not to mention troubleshoot
anything that's not working right!

Your job is to help your customers get the most out of their purchase and feel like they have

gotten true value for their money. Make it your goal to learn everything there is to know about
your product so you can amaze your customers with timely recommendations for using new
features and services.

2. MAINTAIN A POSITIVE ATTITUDE

Attitude is everything, and a positive attitude goes a long way in providing excellent customer
service.

"The right attitude changes negative customer experiences into positive customer
experiences,"
, VP of Operations and Customer Service at DigiCert, Inc.
says Flavio Martins
Since most customer interactions are not face_to_face, your attitude should be reflected in
your language and tone of voice.

It's easy to misinterpret the tone of written communication, and email or live chat can come
across as cold. The brain
 to interpret someone else's emotional tone,
uses multiple signals
including body language and facial expression, many of which are absent online.

Don't be afraid to pick up the phone if you find an email or chat conversation getting tense.

3. CREATIVELY PROBLEM_SOLVE

One of the biggest reasons customers churn is because they experienced bad customer
service. That's why you must thrive on solving problems for your customers and make it a
central part of your support role — and there will always be problems to solve.

Everyone has heard of the legendary customer service at Zappos. For example, they once
sent

the night before the wedding after his order was sent to the wrong
a best man free shoes
location due to a mistake by the delivery company. Zappos solved a problem and exemplified
excellent customer service — they won a customer for life and gave the man a story that he
couldn't wait to share.

Don't be afraid to wow your customers as you seek to problem_solve for them. You could just
fix the issue and be on your way, but by creatively meeting their needs in ways that go above
and beyond, you'll create customers that are committed to you and your product.

4. RESPOND QUICKLY

Most Business owners believe that valuing their time is the most important thing in any online
customer experience. Resolving customer queries as quickly as possible is a cornerstone of
good customer service. Speed should be of the essence — especially for smaller issues that
don't take much time to solve.

That being said — great customer service beats speed every time.

Customers understand that more complex queries take time to resolve. There's a difference
between the time it takes you to respond and the speed at which you resolve their problems.
Customers don't want to languish in a ticket queue, but they'll spend as much time as it takes

to resolve their issue. You should, too.

Get back to your customers as quickly as possible, but don't be in a rush to get them off the
phone or close the ticket without resolving the issue completely.

5. PERSONALIZE YOUR SERVICE

Very often, customers say they want better human service. That means they want to feel like
they are more than just a ticket number. They get angry when they're not being treated like an
individual person, receiving boilerplate responses, or being batted like a tennis ball to
different people.

Customers want to interact with a person — not a company. It's part of the reason why many
businesses send gifts to their customers on their birthdays.

Do you know not only your customers' names, but also their birthdays? How about their
interests or hobbies? Can you make them laugh? It's obviously not possible to do this for

everyone, but going off script and giving the personal touch when you can is an important way
to show your customers you know them and you care.

6. HELP CUSTOMERS HELP THEMSELVES

That said, customers don't always want to talk to someone to get their problem solved —
often, they want to quickly resolve their issue themselves. Among consumers,
81% attempt to

before reaching out to a live representative. Further research
take care of matters themselves
shows that
 to solve most customer service issues on their own.
71% want the ability

Self_service is a scalable, cost_effective way to make customers happy. If we can provide the
resources so that they can help themselves in the future, their experience with our products
will be better for it.

7. FOCUS SUPPORT ON THE CUSTOMER

Your customers are the most integral part of your business, and they come before products or
profit. Treat them like they are the center of your world — because they are.

According to Kristin Smaby in "
," "It's time to consider an
Being Human is Good Business
entirely different approach: Building human_centric customer service through great people
and clever technology. So, get to know your customers. Humanize them. Humanize yourself. It'
s worth it."

Southwest Airlines
 in a very memorable way when one of its
put this principle into practice
pilots held a flight back to wait for a customer traveling to a funeral. They put the human
before their targets, and that customer will never forget it.

8. ACTIVELY LISTEN

Paying attention to customer feedback includes looking back over the data, as well as listening
in real_time. Show your customers you hear them when they take the time to speak to you.
Listening increases the chances that you'll hear your customers' real problems and can
effectively solve them, resulting in happier customers.

Listen to what they have to say without pushing your own agenda. Don't assume that you
know what your customer is going to say.

Demonstrate active listening skills; when you're on the phone or live chat, use phrases like "It
sounds like … " and "Do you mean … ?" or "Let me make sure I've got this right." Make sure you
repeat the problem back to them in your own words to show you've heard them.

Active listening also means you are mindful of your customer's unique personality and current
emotional state so you can tailor your response to fit the situation. Customer service is not
one_size_fits_all.

9. KEEP YOUR WORD

If you promise something, making sure you deliver on it is common_sense customer service.
Don't let your customers down. Keeping your word is about respect and trust.

For example, if you promise an SLA uptime of 99%, make sure you keep to that standard. If
you promise to develop a certain feature in your software in a particular time frame, make
sure you deliver on that.

When you break your word, like saying you'll get back to a customer within 24 hours and you
don't, offer something to make up for it. If your customer's delivery goes awry, offer to replace
it and refund their money for their trouble. You might lose some money in the short term, but
you'll gain a loyal customer.

Interestingly, customers
 when you deliver more than you promised.
do not feel extra grateful
They do, however, feel angry if you break a promise. It's still better to under_promise and over_
deliver so you can make sure you never break this important social contract.

10. BE PROACTIVELY HELPFUL

Going the extra mile is one of the most important things you can do to deliver great customer
service. This is when you have ticked all the boxes, yet you still want to do more.

Sometimes being helpful means anticipating your customers' needs before they even have to
articulate them. In fact, sometimes customers may ask for one thing without realizing that
they really need another. It's your job to anticipate their needs and provide for them.

When customers feel like you value them — like they're truly special to you — they'll keep
coming back. If you do something nice for your customers, they will want to do something in
return — like buy your products!

## Fundamental Sales Terminology
ACTIVITY_BASED SELLING

Activity_based selling is a sales strategy where reps focus on a series of clearly defined,
cascading actions that make a sale happen, rather than prioritizing the closing of the deal
itself (results_based selling).

This approach helps reps stay organized and motivated by giving them control over how much
time they spend on certain tasks and allowing them to set short_term objectives.

For example: "I need to make 10 sales this month. I typically need to send 100 proposals to
reach that target, so this week my goal is to send 25 proposals out to leads".

ANNUAL CONTRACT VALUE (ACV)

Annual contract value, or ACV, is a measurement that shows how much an ongoing customer
contract is worth by averaging and normalizing its value over one year.

You can use ACV to gauge the dollar value of customer accounts that involve monthly
subscriptions, differently priced plans and multi_year contracts.

ANNUAL RECURRING REVENUE (ARR)

Annual recurring revenue, or ARR, is a metric that shows the amount of recurring income a
business generates from all of its subscription accounts.

ARR is particularly useful to measure sales performance within a SaaS (software as a service)
business.

B2B (BUSINESS TO BUSINESS)

B2B describes the relationship between a buyer and seller in which both parties are
businesses. For example, Pipedrive provides sales CRM and pipeline management software to
other companies to empower their sales teams, so we operate a B2B model.

B2C (BUSINESS TO CONSUMER)

B2C describes the relationship between a buyer and seller when the seller is a business and
the buyer is an individual consumer. For example, Netflix sells its streaming service to
individual users, so it operates a B2C model.

BUYER PERSONA

A buyer persona is a semi_fictional representation of a business's ideal customer based on
market research and existing customer data.

Inbound marketers use buyer personas to define their target audiences so they can create
content that reaches and resonates with potential customers.

Sales reps can use the same profiles to qualify leads (e.g. "This website visitor matches the
demographic profile of our ideal customer, so they're more likely to be interested in buying
our product and are therefore worth spending time on").

BUYING CRITERIA

Buying criteria are pieces of information a consumer needs to make a buying decision. While

all buyers have their own criteria, this type of information generally includes answers to
questions such as:

• What is the product?

• Why should I buy it?

• How will it benefit me?

• How much does it cost?

• Why should I buy it from your business?

Buying process (also called a buying/buyer/customer journey). The buying process is a
sequence of steps that a buyer takes to become a customer. While theories vary in detail, most
buying processes follow a similar pattern:

• Problem recognition

• Information search

• Evaluation of alternatives

• Purchase decision

• Purchase

• Post_purchase evaluation

As with customer lifecycles and sales funnels, the stages of the buying process help
salespeople understand what their prospects might be feeling and looking for at any time.

CHURN RATE

Churn rate is a measure of how many customers stop using a product or buying from a
business.

To calculate churn rate, divide the number of customers you lose in a certain timeframe by the
total customers at the start of the same period. Then multiply the result by 100 to get a
percentage.

For example:

20 customers lost in March ÷ 250 customers on board at the start of March = 0.08

0.08 x 100 = a churn rate of 8%

COLD CALLING

Cold calling is an outbound sales technique where a rep makes first_time calls to prospective
customers who haven't expressed interest in their product before (but do match the ideal
customer profile).

While the recipient of a cold call might not be aware of the brand contacting them, a good
sales rep will qualify prospects first by making sure they fit their business's ideal buyer profile.

CONSULTATIVE SELLING

Consultative selling is a "buyer_first" sales approach that prioritizes customer relationships
over selling a particular product.

A salesperson using consultative selling will focus on their customer's needs and biggest pain
points, before they try to provide a solution.

This way, the solution they put forward (and how they frame it) is relevant and personalized.

CONVERSION

In sales, a conversion is when a prospect becomes a lead, or a lead becomes a customer.

In marketing, the term broadly describes when the recipient of a marketing message
completes a desired action, like when a website visitor signs up to your mailing list or provides
their contact information.

You can measure the success of sales and marketing efforts using conversion rates. In sales,
you could calculate this by dividing the number of qualified leads by the number of converted
customers.

CROSS_SELLING

Cross_selling describes a sales opportunity that involves selling different products to an
existing customer.

Cross_selling usually involves selling a product or service that is related to or complements
one the customer in question already owns. For example, an electronics sales rep who sells a
mobile phone to a consumer could encourage them to buy a wireless charger or protective
case.

CUSTOMER ACQUISITION COST (CAC)

Customer acquisition cost, or CAC, is a measurement of the total sales and marketing cost a
business requires to earn a new customer over a tracked period. The cost comprises all

spending in these areas, including salaries, commissions, bonuses, sales tools and travel
expenses.

By measuring and subsequently reducing its CAC, a company can determine and increase its
profitability.

CUSTOMER LIFECYCLE

The customer lifecycle is a multi_stage (and repeatable) journey customers go through, from
first hearing about a brand to becoming one of its ambassadors.

There are seven stages in a typical customer lifecycle:

5. Awareness
Engagement
Consideration
Conversion
Support

7. Loyalty
Advocacy

Salespeople and marketers can use the stages of this buyer's journey to understand their
customers' needs and emotions. For example, during the consideration stage, a prospect
needs the type of information that will help them compare one product to others on the
market.

CUSTOMER LIFETIME VALUE (CLV)

Customer lifetime value, or CLV, is a metric that indicates the total revenue a business can
expect from a single customer account during a B2C or B2B sales relationship.

To calculate company_wide CLV (with the right data, you can do it for distinct customer
categories, too), you'll need the following information:

Average purchase value

How to calculate (The total value of customer transactions over a certain period / the number
of transactions in the same timeframe)

Average purchase frequency

How to calculate (The number of transactions in the chosen period / the number of customers
who made a purchase)

Customer value

How to Calculate (The average purchase frequency x the average purchase value)

Average customer lifespan

How to calculate (The total sum of customer lifespans [length of time over which a customer
continues to buy from you] / the number of customers in the same period)

CLV

(customer value x average customer lifespan)

When you increase CLV by improving customer experience (to increase customer loyalty), your
business becomes more profitable and efficient.

CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT (CRM)

Customer relationship management, or CRM, describes the technology and processes an
organization uses to manage relationships with prospects, leads and customers.

The use of the word "customer" in CRM encompasses many types of relationships. As well as
buyers, sales CRM tools like Pipedrive help businesses monitor and maintain relationships
with:

• Employees

• Suppliers

• Partners

• Brand advocates

• Marketing contacts

• Candidates

Some CRM software includes automation features that help sales managers, account
executives and reps to automate repetitive tasks such as scheduling follow_up and discovery
calls.

DECISION_MAKER

A decision_maker is a person at an organization who has the final say over B2B purchasing
decisions.

Sales reps don't always talk directly to decision_makers when selling (they might negotiate
with a representative instead), but they're worthwhile prospecting targets as long as they have
a direct line to a decision_maker.

If possible, communicate directly with decision_makers. This way, you can:

• Convey your value proposition without it being diluted or miscommunicated

• Shorten the sales cycle to increase efficiency

FORECASTING

Forecasting is the act of using historical data to estimate future sales performance over a
forecast period.

Accurate sales forecasts help reps plan their time and allow managers to set expectations
around performance goals and expenses.

GATEKEEPER

A gatekeeper is a person at an organization who decides which information gets through to a
decision_maker within their business. For example, a receptionist who screens calls for a
procurement manager is a gatekeeper.

Personal assistants and office managers often act as gatekeepers, too.

A great sales rep will have a range of tactics to get past gatekeepers, so they're able to
communicate effectively and efficiently with buyers, especially when cold calling and cold
emailing.

INCREMENTAL SALES

Incremental sales is a measurement of the value of products or services a business sells
during a tracked period that goes beyond what it might normally sell.

A company might monitor incremental sales to determine the impact of promotional activities
or new sales tactics.

INSIDE SALES

Inside sales is the process of selling products and services remotely through means such as
phone calls, emails and video conferencing. Inside sales is also sometimes called virtual sales
or remote sales.

The main benefit of inside sales is that sales representatives can form relationships and sell to
anyone, regardless of their location.

LEAD

A lead is someone who fits the seller's ideal customer profile but is yet to demonstrate any
intent to buy a product beyond engaging with emails or other content marketing materials.

Leads sit between the top of the funnel and the middle, where reps can encourage them
forward using targeted cold calls and emails. Marketers can help nurture leads by creating
relevant content (including sales enablement content).

ONBOARDING

Onboarding is the post_purchase process of acquainting new clients or users with your
product.

It aims to give paying customers the best possible early experience of a product to help create
valuable long_term relationships and reduce churn rates.

OUTSIDE SALES

Outside sales is the process of selling products and services in person through face_to_face
meetings.

Outside sales is also known as field sales. While outside sales reps sometimes use an office as
a base, they spend most of their time meeting leads and customers in the field.

PAIN POINT

A pain point is a specific problem that drives a business's prospective customers to search for
a solution.

For example, a consumer who keeps losing their keys (the pain point) may search the market
for a GPS tracking keyring (the solution).

The sales rep's job is to help buyers address pain points by providing or recommending
suitable products.

PIPELINE (OR SALES PIPELINE)

A pipeline, or sales pipeline, is an organized, visual way of tracking potential buyers through
the various stages of their purchasing journeys.

Sales pipelines are often presented as horizontal bars or funnels comprising stages that match
the organization's sales process, such as:

5. Prospecting
Qualifying
Contacting
Relationship_building
Closing

PROSPECT

A prospect is someone who has demonstrated interest in a product or service, shown intent to
make a purchase and is open to finding out more from the seller about their solution.

Prospects sit between the middle and bottom of the funnel, where reps can nurture them
using personalized communication (instead of more broadly targeted cold calls, cold emails or
marketing content).

PROSPECTING

Prospecting is an activity where reps aim to find potential customers (leads and others who fit
the ideal customer profile) and move them into their company's sales funnel, where they can
nurture them towards becoming a customer.

QUALIFIED LEAD

A qualified lead is the most sought_after potential customer. This is someone who has
expressed interest in buying a product and also has the budget, authority, need and
timeframe (a methodology known by the acronym "BANT") to make a purchase.

It's important to know the difference between a marketing qualified lead (MQL) and sales

qualified lead (SQL).

An MQL is someone who has demonstrated interest by interacting with a business's marketing
team or output (e.g. by downloading a piece of content) but is yet to enter the sales funnel.

An SQL has been vetted by sales and meets all the criteria above, meaning they've entered the
sales funnel and reps can nurture them towards a purchase decision.

QUOTA (OR SALES QUOTA)

A quota is a set number or value of sales that a salesperson is expected to meet over a given
period, often a month or quarter. Sales managers set quotas for their reps to hit so they can
measure and compare individual and team performance.

By monitoring quota performance, sales leaders can reward top performers and identify
underperforming reps, and plan their coaching accordingly.

SALES ENABLEMENT

Sales enablement is the strategic process of creating and providing the tools sales teams need
to sell products effectively. This is a key part of sales and marketing alignment.

Both sales and marketing teams develop sales enablement assets, common examples of
which include:

• Blog content and product guides

• Case studies and testimonial content

• Technical documentation for products

• Sales scripts and pitch templates

SALES FUNNEL

A sales funnel is a visual representation of the journey, from a prospect's first interaction with
a business (such as a website visit) to the point that they purchase a product.

A classic sales funnel has three distinct stages:

• Awareness and discovery (top of the funnel)

• Researching (middle of the funnel)

• Making a purchase decision (bottom of the funnel).

The goal of sales reps and marketers at each is to move prospects onto the next stage.

SALES MANAGEMENT

Sales management is the process of developing a sales force, coordinating sales operations
and implementing techniques and processes that enable a business to reach its sales targets.

There are three distinct aspects of sales management: operations, strategy and analysis.

SALES METRICS

Sales metrics are key performance indicators (KPIs) that allow an organization, team or
individual to measure sales performance. Examples of sales metrics are:

• Customer satisfaction (usually measured on a scale)

• Sales revenue generated

• Win rate

• Average deal size

• Average profit margin

• Quota attainment

• Customer response time

Sales professionals often have a lot of sales data, but the key sales metrics help them
understand what's really happening. Often, they'll visualize these metrics on sales dashboards,
a common feature of CRM tools.

SOCIAL SELLING

Social selling is a lead_generation tactic where sales reps are active in the same social media
spaces as their prospects.

It aims to build trust so that when an ideal customer needs a product or service that your
business sells, they think of you.

UPSELLING

Upselling is when a rep encourages a customer to purchase a higher_end (and higher_priced)
product than the one in question to increase revenue for their business.

For example, a car salesperson responding to an inquiry about a base model car could
encourage the prospect to test drive (and ultimately buy) a more expensive model with
additional features.

VALUE PROPOSITION

A value proposition is a short statement used in marketing materials and sales
communications to give potential customers an immediate glimpse of a brand's offering.

A value proposition should highlight a product, service or brand's differentiating features in a
way that addresses potential objections and expected customer needs.

For example:

"We solve [problem] by providing [benefit], to help [customer] achieve [customer's goal]."

## Marketing Services Digital Ad Campaigns vs. Take Over Campaign (MCC Takeover)

This card will highlight how a MCC Takeover campaign differs from your standard Digital Ad
Campaign:

• These campaigns are not created by the Marketing Services team, but rather, we are

granted access to a client's ad account to 'take over' their ad campaign.

• Once we receive access, our strategist will review the current campaign's performance

and will provide a preliminary recommendations and findings to the communications

team to pass along to the partner. (it is up to the partner's discretion to accept

/implement these changes)

• After this our team will continue to do monthly optimization as per the regular ad

campaign process.

• Due the ad spend, Take over campaigns qualify for monthly Strategy Calls with our

Digital Ads Strategist. These calls will be booked and hosted by the strategist.

note: Typical ad campaign communications will still live with the communications teams. ie: ad
copy changes or edits, general questions regarding the ad campaign, etc.

How to provide access to Takeover Ad Accounts

The Partner needs to provide:

FOR GOOGLE ADS:

1. The account 10_digit Google ad account Customer ID

button
accounts

in the left hand toolbar (see screenshot below)

![](/img/guru/MS-General/18.png)

• From here, you can enter your desired PID into the search bar (see screenshot below)

![](/img/guru/MS-General/19.png)

• The search function will start working as soon as you type in your PID. It should only

take a second (see screenshot below)

![](/img/guru/MS-General/20.png)

• Go ahead and click on the account you're looking for!

Using SSC:

• SSC is a great tool for Marketing Services, as we can use it for the following:

• Confirming/updating contact details

• Leaving notes within the account when projects have hit full bounce_back, have

canceled, or escalated

• Leaving notes to inform our Sales team about upcoming projects, plans or process

changes for the Partner

• Review this
 of how to navigate, add notes, and some best practices.
video

• To add a note in SSC, you must select the 'Log a call, email, or meeting' button

(highlighted in the screenshot below)

![](/img/guru/MS-General/21.png)

• The note function will open, and you're ready to begin

• Under 'Select Activity' choose Other

• In the 'Action' box enter Marketing Services

• Within the text box, use the post format in the instruction below (and shown in this

screenshot)

• Click the 'Select Opportunity' dropdown and choose None

• You're all set! Select
 to post your note!
Add

![](/img/guru/MS-General/22.png)

• Please, use this format for your posts within SSC:

• AGID:

Update:

Communication with:

• If you have questions about whether or not your note belongs in SSC, please ask your

team leader before you post. Thank you!

Retention:

In some cases, you may be coming to SSC to update information surrounding an escalation
with a PID.

• When adding information about an escalation or retention effort in SSC, best practice is

to add your notes to an existing 'Retention Opportunity' (screenshot below)

![](/img/guru/MS-General/23.png)

• Once you are within the Retention Opportunity (in this instance it is titled 'Subscription

Cancellation') you can click on
to leave a note within this
Log a call, email or meeting

opportunity. This is helpful for multiple reasons:

• It keeps all information about the situation within one place for MS and Sales

• The Retention team can refer to this directly for more information

![](/img/guru/MS-General/24.png)

• You need to remember to leave the following info within the note:

• PID

• AGID

• Comms team members involved

• Account Manager

• Product Ordered

• Slack Thread Link(s)

• Brief Explanation

Contact Information:

SSC can be used to confirm contact information for your Partner when fulfilling orders in
Marketing Services.

• Finding Contact Information: Within an account on SSC, you will find the 'Contacts'

section listen on the left hand side. In most cases, you will have to scroll down a bit to

find it!

• Users will be listed, and have an arrow you can click to dropdown and display more

information (see screenshot below)

![](/img/guru/MS-General/25.png)

• IMPORTANT REMINDERS:

• This list is only to be used when contacting the Partner. Do not contact other names

listed unless directly advised to do so!

• If you find a discrepancy in the contact information on the account, DO NOT EDIT IT.

Please, reach out to the Account Manager to let them know, and to confirm contact

information.

Proposed Workflow:

Coordinators will incorporate SSC into their workflow by:

• Onboards: While preparing for onboards Coordinators can refer to SSC to confirm

contact info, order history, and any additional notes that may be helpful for us to know

prior to speaking with Partners & Clients.

• Tickets: SSC will be used to confirm contact info, leave notes (requests, processes,

preferences, tips, etc) in the notes card of the account, and loop in the assigned Account

Manager/Account Executive/Retention teams to any specific information shared by

Partner & Clients.

• Projects: Comms will incorporate SSC into our bounce_back process. We will be

confirming contact info, referring to SSC to see if there has been recent movement on

the account, and leaving notes within SSC when our efforts to contact Partners have

been unheard. When projects are closed or reopened, we can leave internal notes within

SSC to keep all teams informed.

• These notes will be left as activity on the account with the label, "Marketing Services

Note"

• Retention: Often, we are the last team to learn about a cancellation, and rarely receive

any additional context. Our retention efforts will include referring to SSC, leaving notes

& feedback from our Partners, and bridging the gap between MS & Vendasta Sales

teams.

• Financial Health: You can see the Partner's Financial Health at the top of the account,

which will show Green if it's Healthy, Yellow if there might be failed payments, and red if

they're restricted.

![](/img/guru/MS-General/26.png)

• Internal Communication: Slack will still be our primary way of communicating with the

Sales team, but we want to leverage the use of SSC to help make the interactions as

quick, and helpful as possible.

• For example: reaching out to the AM with the message of, "I have not been able to

reach anyone at Company Name. Is there someone I should be reaching out to?"

Which requires the AM to take some time to grab contact information for someone

specific for Marketing Services to reach out to.

• Instead, they could ask, "I have been reaching out to Andrew Carson's email

acarson@email.com and calling them at 306_955_5512, although it looks like they

have an alternative email in SSC of andrewc@email.com and phone number 402_

955_5512. Should I be reaching out to them using that email and phone number

instead?" Then the AM can say Yes, or No, and possibly refer to other contact info.

• If a coordinator discovers there is incorrect information within an account, they

make an edit, but flag it with the Account Manager.
will not

## Directwest _ Listings / Comms GBAS Workflow
Hey there!

We are making some new and exciting changes to ensure we can serve our clients better, and
we noticed a gap in efficiency that we can now implement to ensure we do the work we need
to with less communication with the client which tends to slow down our operations and cause
confusion for the end user.

Goal:

• Centralizing Ownership:

• Own/Manage more listings through our digitalteam@directwest.com email

• Minimize Confusion:

• Communication with clients who are usually unaware of the individual emails created

a long time ago tends to become unhelpful to the progress of the re_verification or

simply logging in.'

SO, what are the new steps?

• The Listings Team will do their typical GBAS Check_Up

• If the Google account on file offers any problems (ie. 2FA, changed password, etc)

they will request Owner/Management to the listings from digitalteam@directwest.

com

• Fields:

• Level of access: Ownership

• Select one: I own/work for an agency that represents this business

• Name: Directwest

• Phone: 306_653_1210

• Agency name: Directwest

• The Listings Team will update the task notes for the Verticals Client Engagement Team

and assign them to Digital Team as usual, informing them of the request being sent

• The Verticals Client Engagement Team will then send a follow_up to the client via email

in question to inform them of the request being sent (so they are aware this isn't any

type of scam) and ensure that they know that if the request isn't approved that we will

be claiming and verifying the listing via phone call, SMS, email, or video within the next 5

business days.

• Email allows for the client to see it coming from the branded email we are also

requesting management/ownership from

• Once the Verticals Client Engagement Team has sent the info to the client, they'll assign

the task back to the Listings Team so that they can keep tabs on the request for access.

• If the request for access is successful, the Listings Team will add the DW Fulfillment

location group to the listing and complete the GBAS check as usual

• It is not likely that the request for access will be successful, but it does occasionally

happen

• If the request for access is rejected or ignored, the Listings Team will be able to "appeal"

the request after 3 business days. As part of this appeal process, Google will give the

option to verify the listing by phone call, SMS, email, or video.

• The Listings Team will notify the Verticals Client Engagement Team in the task notes

about which options are offered, then assign the task to them

• The Verticals Client Engagement Team will then connect with the client to

complete the verification

• The Listings Team will be able to add the DW Fulfillment location group to the listing

at this point, making the listing viewable from any Marketing Services account

• Once the Verticals Client Engagement Team has completed the verification, they will

assign the task back to the Listings Team, who will complete their regular NAP check.

Verticals Communication Macro

Hi there!

We wanted to let you know that our Listings Management Team has recently requested access
to your Google listing as a part of our re_verification methods. The email we had on file that
has access had some barriers to entry and this hurts our team's ability to continue serving you
and your listing. This request will be coming from our verified email digitalteam@directwest.
com, if you see this request please accept the invitation!

After three business days, the listing will be available for claiming and allow us to verify again
by phone call, SMS, email, or video, so you may hear from us over the phone to finish the
verification.

If you have any questions related to this, don't hesitate to reach out. As a reminder, this comes
at no extra cost as this is already a part of the management work we do for you.

Thanks,

Directwest Team

## Marketing Services X MDF Program
This information is also in Confluence for reference!

MDF programs have not been utilized by IT resellers, the programs are complicated, time_
consuming, and not well_defined. Resellers do not have the marketing expertise or resources
to utilize the fund that is available. As a result, many of these funds tend to expire which does
not benefit the program or the IT provider. Marketing Services delivers a handful of services in
the package for MDF partners, including, content, websites, and digital ads. Their process is
different in the sense that the funds are heavily managed and the requirements for these
deliverables have to be met.

Important to Note: All MDF partners know we are Vendasta, so there is no risk of white_label
break.

Communication Stakeholders:

@Logan Ochitwa has been the main contact for Marketing Services concerns.

IT Channel: @Andrew Down @Logan Ochitwa @Adam Soltys @Mohamed Ismail

Marketing Service: @Katherine Ingram @Nathan Yaworski

Channels: msp_mdf td_synnex_demandsolv
Ingram Micro _ Matchcraft Campaigns CMIT

Expectations for Marketing Services

![](/img/guru/MS-General/35.png)

Digital Ads

1st Order (Digital Ads Creatives)
Process

1. Digital Ads Creatives are usually ordered first in the program because they likely will

complete an accelerant cycle. In the future we would like to have a bank of options

for partners however, at the moment we deliver the typical digital ad set to the

partner with the typical processes.

Digital Ads Campaign (Post Creatives Deliverable & Run of Adcellerant)

Process for Quick Launch (typical second order): https://app.getguru.com/card/c9A8G7Ai

/Digital_Ads_Quick_Launch_Campaigns

1. Follow the normal process for campaigns however, when funds run out and

campaigns are canceled we notify @Logan Ochitwa rather than the partner because

he will be aware of the fund expiration/exhaustion.

Examples: coming

Websites

Process: https://app.getguru.com/card/cKkerkXi/Communications_Website_Onboard_Checklist

The typical process for website builds is followed for the MDF projects. Occasionally, they
create the website specifically for the use of the funds and their reimbursement around MDF
requirements.

Example: coming

Social/Content

Social Posting _ MDF

1. The onboarding process is similar to regular partnerships however, in the future, the

ideal scenario that we are working on is having a team member join @Logan Ochitwa

& the reseller on a call to complete the onboarding in quick sync because it is difficult

to make contact with the partner once we received a commitment from them. In this

scenario, Logan would contact us the day of or the day before to see our availability

to join the call and make sure we are included.

2. During the onboarding calls, we ask what requirements are needed to receive their

reimbursements from MDF and make sure the Social Team is aware of these

requirements.

3. Content and Strategy calls are utilized every month. Be sure to book these in advance

every month so they are completed. Meetings can be shortened if necessary. If they

also have blogs active we would ask about a topic during this call as well.

Social Posting _ TD Synnex

1. The onboarding process is the typical process however, the delivery is altered to TD

Synnex portal requirements.

2. TD Synnex clients do not require account connections. They will require that

deliverables are sent to them through an excel sheet in which they can review, send

feedback, and we alter the posts. This is because the content has to be uploaded into

the website portal we host for them. *Katherine will be creating a GURU card

outlining the process for uploading to the portal.

Email Campaigns _ not an actual product in the marketplace

1. These orders can come through as one_time blogs that are utilized in a different

manner.

2. They are delivered on the same timeline as regular blogs (5 business days after order

is placed.

Blogs

1. This follows the typical process.

2. We send out the blog on the deadline, receive revisions, etc.

Case Studies are not an actual product in the marketplace

1. These are not typical products that all partners can order. Case Studies are utilized for

some of the IT Resellers.

2. The timeline for deliverables is once the call and content are received from the client

/partner we have 5 business days to complete the copy, then 5 business days to

complete the design aspects & deliver the piece.

3. Please note that case studies are only ordered when they are approved.

CANCELLATIONS

1. If cancelations are processed the usual reasoning for the cancelation is that the MDF

has run its course. Many of the partners/resellers are not aware of the spending

requirements or allowances so I check in with Logan to ensure the reasoning behind

the cancelation is funds related not services related.

2. There are also cancelations for the reasoning that their 'cycle' with their partnership

IE. TD Synnex or CISCO has run its course. They sign up for a certain amount of time

for trial and can extend if they wish. This can be highlighted by the partner

themselves or by Logan.

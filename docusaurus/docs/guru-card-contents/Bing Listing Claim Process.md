# Bing Listing Claim Process

The Listings team will start the Bing task and either create a new Bing listing or claim an

existing one.

The Listing team will note down the methods available to verify the listing in the task notes

and assign the task to the comms assignee to reach out and complete the verification.

The Comms team will sign into our Bing Places for Business account.

https://www.bingplaces.com/Authentication/Index

Sign in through Google!

Username: bingplaces@yourdigitalagents.com, Password: MSListings2023!

Search for the listing by business name (The business name might be different so if you

cannot find it, please check the "Check for existing listing" task or ask the Listings Team).

Once the listing comes up, click into it.

Right at the top you will notice the verification options. (Screenshot shown below as well):

The usual methods found on Bing are:

Phone Call Verification (Whatever number is currently on the listing is the one that must

be used for verification purposes. Cannot change until fully verified).

SMS/Text Code (If the business number is a personal cell phone number).

Email (Must be a domain email address).

Postcard (Currently unavailable until further notice due to an issue on Bing's end).

:::tip
Please Note: The email verification tends to timeout very quickly so the option might not be there after a couple of days.
:::

Attempt the phone or email verification methods and see if the listing becomes verified.

If the code is accepted, assign the "Claim and Verify" Bing task back to the Listing Team

member and leave notes.

If the verification is rejected or the methods available cannot be completed, assign the

task back to the Listings team member and leave notes indicating why the verification

couldn't be completed. The Listings Team member will reach out to Bing Support and

usually, the two options we receive are:

The Bing rep will call the business directly and verify our association and the listing

with the client.

Send an email to a domain email address or an email address advertised on the

business website to verify our association and the listing.

:::tip
PLEASE NOTE: We should notify the partner/client beforehand that they might
:::

receive a phone call or email from Bing to verify the listing before the Listings Team

starts this process.

If the listing needs any edits done to it after verification (whether it be to match PC or partner

/client request), a re verification will most likely be required. We can also send access to the

listing to any email but only upon request.

Bing Listing Policies

Bing is not as strict as Google when it comes to listing info being accurate but we should

always strive for the most accurate info as possible (PC is our main listing info source).

Bing will accept tracking numbers (unlike Google) but they do have the right to reject the edit if

they deem so.

Bing accepts service area businesses and physical location businesses only, just like Google.

(No e commerce/online only businesses allowed).

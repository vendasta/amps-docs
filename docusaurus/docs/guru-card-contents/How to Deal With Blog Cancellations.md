# How to Deal With Blog Cancellations

Sometimes we deal with cancellations�and that's okay. But how do we deal with it in our lifeline and 
VTM? It can get confusing this card can help you navigate that process.

When we get cancellation emails, they include two things: a cancellation date and a deactivation date.

The cancellation date is the day they canceled (straight forward).

The deactivation date is the day BEFORE they would've paid for their blog for the CURRENT month.

So, if a client cancels their blogs on September 28th, but the deactivation says September 29th, this 
means the client would not receive a September blog.
However, if the client cancels on September 28th, but the deactivation says September 30th, they 
WOULD receive a September blog. They would also receive a September blog if the Deactivation is

in October.

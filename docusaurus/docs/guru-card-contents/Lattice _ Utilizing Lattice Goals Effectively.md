# Lattice   Utilizing Lattice Goals Effectively

Lattice Goals is a powerful tool designed to help us set, track, and achieve our goals effectively. Let's 
try to utilize it for self growth.

Setting SMART Goals: Utilize the SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,

Time bound) when setting goals in Lattice. Ensure that goals are clearly defined, quantifiable,

realistic, aligned with organizational objectives, and have defined timelines for completion.

Utilizing one on ones: This tool is great for agenda setting to make the best use of the weekly

one on one meetings we have.

Monitoring Progress and Performance: Use the "update" section to log your weekly updates.

This may seem like additional work as we know how busy we all are, but this really helps you

understand where you are and where you can be. It's also great to acknowledge your weekly

wins�you deserve that tap on your back!

Aligning expectations: Understand what is expected from you. The "Career tracks" section

under "Grow" helps you understand what is expected from your role, and trying to go above

and beyond in that role ensures success.

Feedback: Through this section, you can give feedback and vice versa. Feedback can help us

acknowledge our areas of improvement and grow from it.

Seeking Training and Support: This would be a great tool to understand what type of training

and support you would be needing and asking the manager to support you with that.

Celebrating Successes: Recognize and celebrate goal achievements and milestones reached

through Lattice Goals.

# Why is Google asking me to re verify the listing 

Once verification is completed, the listing may display "Verification complete." However, in reality, 
Google may still be processing the verification.

When you check the main listing page, you may see the following message:

![](/img/guru/Why%20is%20Google%20asking%20me%20to%20re-verify%20the%20listing_/01.png)

In most cases, the verification is successful. However, there are instances where Google rejects it and 
requests an alternative verification method—most commonly video verification.

If the listing was confirmed and verified, it would have looked like this:

![](/img/guru/Why%20is%20Google%20asking%20me%20to%20re-verify%20the%20listing_/02.png)

The listing is now asking for verification again, which is likely due to changes in the NAP data (Name, 
Address, Phone).

Whenever any of these details are updated, Google requires re verification.

TIP: If the partner or client is frustrated, you can explain that this is Google's way of ensuring that all 
businesses on their platform are legitimate and not scams. While it can be frustrating for legitimate 
businesses, it ultimately helps maintain a trustworthy platform for consumers.
